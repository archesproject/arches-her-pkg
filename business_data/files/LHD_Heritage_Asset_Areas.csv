001c0e41-f561-406f-8855-a7079da852f7,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Swithin,"The parish of St Swithin was quite a populous and wealthy one, including as it did the northern waterfront east of High Bridge and the suburb of Thorngate, and this had some impact on the architecture of the medieval church which is known from early views to have been a large and elaborately detailed building. The prosperity of the citizens might also be indicated by the foundation here of at least two chantries (for the Pinson family in 1324 and the Chesterfield family in 1352 - Venables 1887-8c, 25) and these are likely to have had some impact on liturgical layout. Throughout the later middle ages there is a sequence of elite burials here extending until the early 16th century (ed. Gibbon 1888, 43, 58, 152, 164, 171). The church survived the Reformation and so the site should preserve archaeological evidence for alterations in liturgical layout etc. It seems to have survived in good condition until 1644, when it is said that an explosion of gunpowder in Cornmarket Hill (200m away!) caused damage and a fire which destroyed it (Venables 1887-8c, 26). Thereafter the parish camped out in the ruins of the south aisle, although the date at which they fitted it out seems to be unknown. The reality of this sequence of this events should be visible in the archaeological record and the re-fitting of the south aisle will be of interest in its own right as a rare example of a newly fitted-out church of the later 17th century. The graveyard population of St Swithin is likely to be of considerable interest as, like the church, it will also have contained elite burials, although it may have been dominated by families of lesser rank in this quayside environment. The graveyard continued in use until the 19th century, and, if dealt with as a single population, it will permit a useful study of the development of the parish population through 1000 years.",Summary,The site of the medieval church is known and it extended further south than the 19th-century churchyard wall (RAZ 9.60.45).

005d7890-c528-43b8-bbe6-a5695d8e2bb1,LARA RAZ AREA,,Sewage industry,"Although there had been spasmodic efforts made towards installing an underground sewerage system in the 1840s (Hill 1974, 162), little was achieved, and by 1870 a central government inspector could conclude that ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáthere is not a town in England which offers a more flagrant instance of the dereliction of this duty than the city of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Hill 1974, 169). A pumping engine for Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Sewage works was built in 1876-80 on Great Northern Terrace (Herridge 1999, No.5101), utilising designs by engineers Lawson and Mansergh. Three buildings and a pair of semi-detached houses survive and on the south side of the site is the base of a chimney, which presumably powered the pumping engine. In 1885 pumping power was supplied by two compound engines manufactured by Hathorn Davey and Co of Leeds. The works had their own railway siding provided by the GNR in the 1880s. The internal narrow gauge railway ran to the refuse destructor (Herridge 1999, No.5100) on the east side, built in 1915 to provide power for the sewage farm operation. The pumping engine pumped the sewage to the treatment beds to the east, laid out between the railway and the Washingborough Road and known as Irrigation Farm (Williamson 1890, 156). A group of buildings of uncertain function survive on the Washingborough Road site and should be the subject of recording in conjunction with repairs and alterations. A full research agenda for sites of these types is provided in the Step 1 and Step 3 Reports on the Water industry (Douet 1995; Trueman forthcoming). Future work should concentrate on exploring the development of the sewage system and on the extent to which the city capitalised on the latest national developments. The Corporation were criticised for being behind cities of similar type throughout much of the 19th century and it will be interesting to see if they caught up once investment was made. According to Mills (2001, 142-4) the plant on the south side of the Washingborough Road was also established in 1881. This seems to have had filtration tanks from the first and, therefore, would represent a somewhat different type of, or stage in, the treatment system. Was the sludge pumped up to Washingborough and then fed back through first the tanks and then the irrigation farm on its way back to the Witham? It is said that many adaptations were made to the system following the typhoid outbreak of 1905 and traces of these adaptations would be of considerable interest nationally.Many refuse destructors were built in England between c.1876 and 1914, but few seem to have survived and they have not been subject to systematic study (Trueman 1994, 16; forthcoming). Future work on the site should concentrate on understanding its working, but we should also be interested in the system of refuse collection and transport which the City Council developed to supply fuel to the destructor.",Summary,The various RAZ elements are mapped following the sites‰Û¡ÌÝå» depictions on various O.S. map editions and including a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.47,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.47,

0160612e-4297-450f-b9e3-7591f558fb83,LARA RAZ AREA,,Long distance roads,"The same three roads which had linked Lincoln to other cities and regions in the previous Era continued in use. Ermine Street, which linked the city to London in the south, arrived at the city boundary at Cross o‰Û¡ÌÝå» Cliff Hill, where there was an important boundary marker formed by a cross on top of the hill from at least the 16th century, and probably earlier- (RAZ 9.45.1). From here it headed down the steep slope towards the large open area of Swine Green. The course of the road may have lain along the modern road, which is deeply cut into a hollow way at this point, but alternative routes may survive in earthwork form in South Common to the east. An understanding of the various lines taken by this, the most important of all the access routes to the city, will be gained from both an earthwork survey of South Common and, also, any observations that can be made in the bed of the existing road. Any permanent shifts in its line would presumably have been made in response to changes in the topography to the north. Temporary shifts, on the other hand, may be seasonal and will give us some understanding how the road was used in wet weather. Evidence for repair and neglect of the road might be helpful in indicating the varying weight of traffic over time, especially in comparison with similar results from Ermine Street north of the city and from the Fosse Way. Ermine Street continued north of Lincoln to York (via Till Bridge Lane) and to Hull (via Glandford Bridge and Barton-on-Humber). This road left the walled city at Newport Arch on the line of the modern road. Immediately outside the gate, it passed through Newport market (RAZ 9.19, 10.16) and north of St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church, presumably in the vicinity of the roundabout at Yarborough Crescent, it crossed the defensive ditch which surrounded the Newport suburb. Road works here should be watched for evidence of both the defences themselves, which may have been abandoned by this Era, and the bridge which presumably carried the road over them. There was a boundary marker at the point where the road left the city fields (RAZ 9.45.4 & 10.45.4). Patterns of repair and neglect may be of some use in judging the levels of traffic on the road through time, although such evidence will have to be deployed with care. The third long-distance route, towards Newark and Nottingham, the Fosse Way, joined the modern city boundary at a point well beyond the medieval city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s jurisdiction. Like the Ermine Street north and south of the city, the line of the high medieval road continued in use, including the Witham crossing (RAZ 10.13.1). The early modern road then headed north-eastwards to join Swine Green, again following the line of its high medieval predecessor along modern line of Newark Road. It may be possible to say something about the weight of traffic carried by the road by gathering evidence for its neglect and repair during the early modern period, especially if such results are compared with similar information from the Ermine Street north and south of the city.",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries for all of these roads have been drawn to include a 10m margin along either side of the modern roads.

022dc1dc-eb46-4955-80c5-c34b910eeed0,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Lawrence,"St Lawrence was, like St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (RAZ 10.60.38), a major church in the heart of the most prosperous area of the Early Modern city with elite support to match (ed. Foster 1914, 24-5, 150 etc.). As with St Martin, also, this church was quite a large and sophisticated building by the late Middle Ages. In particular, about 1297 the important chantry of Alexander son of John son of Martin was founded here (ed. Foster 1914, 25; Hill 1948, 152), and this chantry was the subject of further grants in the 14th century. The archaeological remains of this relatively well documented chantry will be of great interest and we should expect some modification of the fabric to accommodate it. In addition we also hear of a chapel of Sts Dunstan and Sebastian (ed. Foster 1914, 24-5), which probably had a detectable impact on the fabric, and the church was also the home of the Guild of St Lawrence (Westlake 1919, 166-75) which should also be visible in the archaeology. It is clear that St Lawrence will provide an excellent example of the liturgical layout of a major city church on the eve of the Reformation and may help in addressing questions about whether the Old Religion was in decline, or whether, in fact, it had widespread popular support (Duffy 1992). Despite its evident prosperity and support in the early 16th century, as in the case of St John Wigford, the City Council decided to use its new powers under the 1549 Act to liquidate the church between 1550 and 1552 (Stocker 1990, 21) and to make a profit out of its fabric and site. Once redundant the church was put to a variety of interesting and well documented uses by the city, which makes the study of the graveyard area in the post-Reformation period particularly interesting. It is clear that by 1613 the church, churchyard and 5 shops along the High Street were the city shambles and these structures merit detailed careful investigation in their own right (RAZ 10.22.7). Furthermore, it was not just the church buildings which were retained but also the steeple (until at least the early 18th century) and this prompts questions about what such a redundant structure might be used for outside an ecclesiastical context. Was it perhaps used for some specialised industrial purpose, or did is simply serve as a secular campanile (we should note that the parish clerk here was charged with ringing the city curfew in 1538 - HMC 1895, 36)? These questions might be answered through archaeological research.",Summary,"The church site is known, as it survived in use as a secular unit owned by the City Council after the Reformation. The RAZ includes the whole churchyard and is bounded on the north and east by the alley known at King‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Arms Yard (the width of which was inside the churchyard). To the south and west it is bounded by High Street and Clasketgate.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.39,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.39,

0231b4e5-034e-4919-b4b7-811bf066852a,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Norman Street Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Norman Street Character Area is a key area for Lincoln's road and bus infrastructure situated south east of the city centre. Its character is mainly the result of large-scale re-organisation of an existing Early Industrial [1750-1845 AD] townscape during the expansion and upgrading of road infrastructure in the southern part of the city in the Post-War Period [1946-1966 AD]. The Character Area consists of one major road, Melville Street/Pelham Bridge, three subsidiary roads (Norman Street, Pelham Street and Oxford Street) and the bus station. Obscure and irregular spaces have been created by the layout of the roads. The larger plots have several uses including a multi-storey car park, a bus station with roof car park, surface-level car parking and Oxford Hall, a student residence. There are also several green areas including an area of grass with planted borders between Pelham Bridge and Pelham Street, plus trees, planters and planted borders at various locations including along the wall of the bus station on Melville Street where trees ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásoften‰Û¡ÌÝå» this strong boundary.The modern road infrastructure has overwritten earlier field boundaries and road patterns but a few elements of the earlier townscape still influence the current character of the area. For example, Melville Street follows the line of a former burgage plot. From as early as the High Medieval Era [850-1350 AD] Sincil Dyke, which is now culverted, was an open drain running south east to north west through the Character Area. The new road infrastructure of the Early Industrial Period linked the new Canwick Road with Broad Street (now Broadgate). The routes of existing roads were changed significantly but some original sections of Oxford and Pelham Street are retained in the townscape. The new road layout has created a number of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáislands‰Û¡ÌÝå», often large in scale, including the site of the car park off Oxford Street and the site of Oxford Hall, which was initially a conversion from two Late Victorian/Edwardian properties (4 and 5 Norman Place) in the Post-War Period.The main building in the Character Area is the bus station, which is a two-storey building that is open on all sides at ground-floor level and has a suspended rooftop car park at first-floor level. It is a concrete structure with red-brick walls around the first floor, which is suspended on concrete pillars that have a wood-effect imprint. From the car park, there are panoramic views of the city. The only other building is the three-storey Oxford Hall student accommodation with white rendered facade and canopy at ground-floor level to the front, including a projecting entranceway. The pitched, hipped roofs and chimneys of Late Victorian/Edwardian properties that were incorporated into the building can still be seen behind the parapet of the later faÌÎå_ade. Many of the features in the Character Area give it a horizontal emphasis such as the footbridge across Melville Street, Pelham Bridge itself and the wide and low design of the bus station. This horizontal emphasis, combined with the large number of roads and the low density of the buildings give most of the Character Area a low sense of enclosure.Railings and fencing are key characteristics of the area, including large amounts of security fencing under Pelham Bridge plus railings to control the movement of pedestrians along many of the roads and on the small road ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáislands‰Û¡ÌÝå» that are used as crossing points. This makes access and movement difficult for pedestrians. The relationship of the Character Area to the city and surrounding areas is closely connected to its highways-dominated townscape. It is situated at the corner of the city centre, at the junction of this and the major road network. Its location between the city centre, including nearby market, and an industrial area to the east means that it is well positioned for providing services such as car parking and a bus terminal. Accessibility through the area varies. For vehicles, there are very good connections to major northern, western and southern routes into and out of the city. However, although there is access on to Pelham Bridge to leave the city heading south, connections to the area immediately to the south are poor as the railway line is a barrier to movement with very limited crossing points. Access to the east for vehicles is also blocked by the Siemens factory, which extends for a considerable distance on the eastern side of Pelham Road. For pedestrians there is good access to the north and west into the city centre but again access to the east is blocked by Siemens and access south is only by the footpath on Pelham Bridge which is very busy or by the footbridge over the railway. The role of the Character Area as a gateway to the city is emphasised by the extensive views both to the north from Pelham Bridge (the Cathedral and upper city extending down the hillside) and to the south (green expanse of South Common and the south escarpment). The latter gives the impression of departing the city and getting straight out into the countryside beyond. The area has a high volume of traffic and buses are frequently arriving and departing. However, the number of pedestrians varies. In the north west of the Character Area, there are many pedestrians arriving and departing from the bus station and car park but there are fewer in the south of the Character Area.The condition of both the buildings and streetscape in the Character Area is quite poor. The surface of the large surface level car park is poor, as is the condition of the security fencing around parts of it.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 9,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,64,

Little seems to be known about this structure, but its buried remains require comparison with the slightly earlier Georgian ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápreaching boxes‰Û¡ÌÝå» at St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Peter Eastgate. The parish underwent a huge increase in population in the century between 1750 and 1850 and the little church was plainly inadequate. A new church was begun on a new site, across Free School Lane in 1869 (RAZ 11.92.8), but burials continued on the old site only until the 1840s. The graveyard population of St Swithin is likely to be of considerable interest as, like the church, it will also have contained elite burials, although it may have been dominated by families of lesser rank in this quayside environment. It will permit a useful study of the development of the parish population through 1000 years. These burials will be particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered a deterioration in their circumstances. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city. Many graveyard memorials of the Industrial Era survive and it is important that the inscriptions they carry are recorded before they become illegible.",Summary,"The extent of the RAZ is defined by the graveyard mapped on the 1st edition O.S. map.

They often have a rectangular plan form or several interconnected rectangular wings, and are positioned towards the centre of large plots with car parking either around the periphery or within a courtyard. The buildings have a horizontal emphasis because of their large footprints and horizontal arrangement of windows; but the tall mature trees, especially outside City Hall and Orchard House, have a vertical emphasis. Construction is generally steel frame with brick or concrete outer shell, though earlier buildings such as County Hall and the former vicarage are of solid brick construction. With the exception of the latter, decoration on buildings is very limited. Doors are often positioned towards the centre of the building as part of a wider public entrance. Due to the civic and public uses that dominate in this area, access is a common feature. There are several footpaths through the area, many of which include access via stairs and a ramp for wheeled access. There is a wide variety of signage providing information to the public and many examples of modern street furniture, often to control traffic, such as mechanical entrances to car parks, parking meters and bollards. Open spaces in the Character Area include several large areas of car parking, a deep wooded verge to the east of City Hall and a further planted verge along West Parade. In addition, mature trees are planted along the boundary of City Hall and there are areas of planting around the boundary of the student accommodation and along the boundary of County Hall on Newland. Plot boundaries are defined in various ways, including wooden fencing, a hedge, a brick wall and iron railings. The proximity of the area to the city centre has influenced its use for civic purposes. In terms of vitality, the area is very active during the day with both passing traffic and visitors to one of the several public buildings in the area either by car or on foot. The area is much quieter at night but is still used by people for parking.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 28,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,48,

The individual traders each developed their own discrete trading areas: the Oat Market was in the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásquare‰Û¡ÌÝå» formed at the junction between St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane and High Street, the corn market was in Cornhill, eggs, butter and perishables were in the Buttermarket north of St Peter-at-Arches. The fish market, which had been on High Bridge, was moved to join the meat market in St Lawrence‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churchyard in 1769 (Hill 1966, 145) and both were relocated in purpose-built accommodation on the south side of Clasketgate in 1774 (RAZ 11.24). But even so the High Street itself was still completely blocked from Cornhill to the Buttermarket on market day at the start of the 19th century (Hill 1966, 214). The Council tried regulation to restrict trading to specified areas, but problems persisted until 1847 when the first Corn Exchange (Herridge 1999, No.5047) was built. This is a building of great interest as a purpose-built exchange. It includes not only large open market spaces but booths along the sides for individual retailers - an early example of a shopping arcade. An additional row of stalls (in a single storey building with a central louver along the length of the roof) was provided along the south side of the square south-east of the new building, although in early photographs this looks somewhat later in date (Elvin 1981, 33). Careful recording will elucidate the original layout of the 1847 building and thus provide insights into the original balance of types of traders. It may also explain how a building on such a low-lying and waterlogged site could have been constructed with elaborate cellars. Subsequent conversions and additions to the buildings will similarly chart the development of different styles of marketing in the city into recent times. The remains of the arcade to the south-east will survive below ground and should be investigated to understand differences between the traders at this site and those in the 1847 building.The new building proved insufficiently large and in 1879 it was augmented by the new Corn Exchange and Market (Herridge 1999, No. 5048). A comparison between the use of space in the two market halls will be most instructive showing the development of retailing in the city over the 30 year period marking the greatest expansion of the city. A comparison between the architectural styles deployed is also instructive. The 1847 building, designed by a local architect (W.A. Nicholson - known especially for his gothick churches) is in a restrained classical style - evidently thought appropriate in the 1840s for the serious business of trade, where as the style of the 1879 building has been called ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáFrench‰Û¡ÌÝå». In fact it is a sort of Second Empire imperial style, which would no doubt have summoned up images of the new imperial capitals of Europe - like the great covered market in Pest, for example, where Clayton‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and Ruston‰Û¡ÌÝå»s both had branch offices and to which they sold most of their machinery. The Corn Exchange underwent a dramatic conversion, expressive of changing times, in 1910 when the upper floor was converted to serve as Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s first cinema (Clark 1991, 8-11). It was however intended to be designed in such a way that the trading floor could be cleared for a weekly corn market on Friday. The technical details of how such a remarkable transformation was achieved each week should be searched for in future work.Similar forces were at work at the Buttermarket (RAZ 10.22.8 - Herridge 1999, No.5283). Here the lower floor of the arcaded building of 1736 was open to the elements and the 19th century saw the provision of screens, walls, gates and windows aimed at making the space more comfortable (Hill 1974, 50-1). Archaeological documentation of these changes will help o",Summary,"The RAZ occupies the High Street from the parish boundary of St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s with St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s northwards to the Buttermarket.

However, as Willingthorpe disappears another focus arose within the suburb. This is the so-called Causey or Cawsey Farm. Although it is not mentioned by name until 1577, Hill showed that the estate may date from the 15th century and represent the family holding of the Cause family (Hill 1948, 330; Cameron 1985, 21). Whether it could ever have been a true manor seems doubtful, but as it was located next to the churchyard of St Stephen's with a hall adjacent to the church, it may have looked like one to contemporaries. As an early example of a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌámodern‰Û¡ÌÝå» farm, set within a small estate of apparently privately owned lands (presumably the closes which may once have been occupied by the tenements of Newland), this is an institution of considerable interest. It would be good to know how its functions were disposed around the site - were beasts housed in an organised crew-yard, for example? And how did the working buildings relate to the farmhouse? Given that the whole estate may have belonged to the Dean and Chapter (as a property supporting the Causey Chantry in the Cathedral), the status of the occupant of the farmhouse itself is of some interest. Finally, we need to know when and how this farm passed out of use.

Further work on the site can only be undertaken on the outlying parts of the burial ground but, nevertheless, such work does have an important role to play. One of the greatest limitations to the value of the evidence from the St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s excavations was the lack of context for the skeletal material recovered. Although a large number of interments were excavated it is not known what percentage of the graveyard population they represent and consequently, even though the level of analysis undertaken on the excavated remains was minimal, even those results cannot be set in context until the whole population within the limits of the graveyard have been recovered. Further work is needed, therefore, on the surviving fragments of graveyard around the totally excavated church to try and set the population already excavated in some meaningful context. It has been suggested elsewhere (RAZ 10.24), that the economy of the Bail may not have taken the spectacular plunge experienced by the lower city in the 14th century; this may suggest that we should explore contrasts rather than similarities between an upper city parish church and those elsewhere in the city, which may have been experiencing the start of a depopulation. There is some evidence for the parish attracting patronage in the late middle ages, demonstrated by the will of Robert Bell, who in 1417 left money for some elaborate obsequies for himself and his brother (ed, Gibbon 1888, 112) The excavation, however, showed that this patronage was not spectacular in scale. Even so further study of the excavation archive should show the liturgical arrangements in place before and after the Reformation and, as comparable evidence at St Mark's was poorly preserved, St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is the most promising city site for our understanding such matters. Similarly it is also the most promising city site at which we might document and understand the changes in liturgical fashion of the 17th and 18th centuries. Most unusual, and important, is the evidence for the backfilling of the well in the eastern part of St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churchyard. The excavations of the fills here showed that it was backfilled in the central part of the 17th century and the fill itself contained many fragments of both stained glass in lead cames and stonework known to have come from the Shrine of Little St Hugh. This material was clearly derived from a bout of iconoclasm, probably that which swept through the Cathedral in 1644. The fact that this debris was used to backfill the well in St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churchyard might itself be adduced as evidence that the well was thought to be a superstitious site in 1644. Its backfilling, therefore, can also be seen as an act of ritual ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáiconoclasm‰Û¡ÌÝå».",Summary,"The site of the churchyard is known, although it is anticipated that the early medieval churchyard will have been larger to the north, east and west than that marked on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map.

It is not part of the role of this document to suggest which of the many different avenues of research making use of the excavation results should be accorded the greatest priority, but the St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s archive provides important evidence for the church in Lincoln during the Early Modern Era. As we might suspect was typical of many Wigford churches, St Marks acquired an additional chapel to the north of the chancel in the later 14th century, which was almost certainly used as the setting for obsequies of the Knight family. So little of the floor survived post-medieval burials that no evidence was found for the re-organisation of the liturgical space at the Reformation, but at this period a south porch of great interest was constructed, which provides important data for future research. The porch was built from re-used masonry which, it was argued, came from one of the other demolished churches in Wigford (perhaps St Edward's - RAZ 10.60.22) and, furthermore, the porch incorporated within its foundations a charnel deposit which we might think came from the same source as the masonry. If this has been interpreted correctly the south porch at St Mark's provides very rare and valuable evidence for the apparently reverent treatment of human remains displaced through church redundancy and demolition in the Reformation period. Further work on the dating of the pottery ware, which was found within the fabric of the porch, would help understanding of this important archaeological deposit (Jennings and Young 1986, 38).",Summary,"The boundaries of the graveyard have been reconstructed from documentary evidence (Gilmour and Stocker 1986, fig.3a) and the RAZ follows these boundaries.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.25,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.25,

04d73b94-68f7-4844-94c5-a90b3358e104,LARA RAZ AREA,,Long distance roads,"These roads, which linked Lincoln to other cities and regions, were less frequently met with in the High Medieval Era than might be imagined. There are only three of them within the city boundary. Ermine Street, which linked the city to London in the south, arrived at the city boundary at Cross O' Cliff Hill, where there was an important boundary marker formed by a cross on top of the hill (RAZ 9.45.1). From here it headed down the steep slope towards the large open area of Swine Green. The course of the road may have lain along the modern road, which is deeply cut into a hollow way at this point, but alternative routes may survive in earthwork form in South Common to the east. As far as we can tell, this road line was a novel one, presumably dating from the Anglo-Saxon period. The Roman route across South Common took a different line (RAZ 6.21, 7.1). An understanding of this, the most important of all the access routes to the city, will be gained from both an earthwork survey of South Common and, also, any observations which can be made in the bed of the existing road. With luck we may be able to establish the date at which the new road was first laid out. Ermine Street continued north of Lincoln to York (via Till Bridge Lane) and to Hull (via Glandford Bridge and Barton-on-Humber). Again this road left the walled city at Newport Arch on the line of the modern road. Immediately outside the gate, it passed through Newport market (RAZ 9.16) and, north of St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church presumably in the vicinity of the roundabout at Yarborough Crescent, it crossed the defensive ditch which surrounded the suburb (RAZ 9.51.1). Road works here should be watched for evidence of both the defences themselves and the bridge which presumably carried the road over them. There was a boundary marker at the point where the road left the city fields (RAZ 9.45.4). This road reuses the line of the Roman road and important information is therefore likely to be available about the extent to which the Roman road system had remained in use through the Early Medieval Era. Consequently discontinuities in alignment between the course of the Roman and medieval roads will be important as well as the stratigraphic sequence.The third long-distance route, towards Newark and Nottingham, the Fosse Way, joined the modern city boundary at a point well beyond the medieval city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s jurisdiction. Like the Ermine Street north of the city, it reuses the line of the Roman road towards its south-western end, but we remain unsure where the Roman road crossed the Witham (RAZ 7.2). Having crossed the Witham at Bracebridge Bridge (RAZ 9.13.1), the medieval road headed north-eastwards to join Swine Green, again following the modern line of Newark Road. Various English medieval law codes give widths of land either side of the road as the zone regarded as the King‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Highway.",Summary,"The RAZ follows the line of the modern roads and includes an additional strip, 10m wide on either side, to accommodate divergences in alignment.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.12.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.12.1,

Although this find indicates the presence of settlement in the vicinity, no structures of Roman Military date were discovered. It is important to understand whether this pottery represents the far end of a development of canabae or a discrete settlement associated with the management of the Legionary prata (RAZ 6.18) - perhaps a 'fundus'. We should note, however, that there was no early pottery from excavations in this general area in 1998, (LHA 33, 44-5)",Summary,This RAZ is based on the discovery of early occupation debris in excavations at Bishop Grosseteste College. It is likely that the settlement features represented will be adjacent to the road and are unlikely to extend more than 100m away from it.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.17,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.17,

06d61682-8fb3-43ce-96dc-f7fab7717636,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Doddington Road South Residential Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌDoddington Road South Character Area is a small residential area dating to the Post-war period located on the southern fringes of the city of Lincoln. The area comprises four residential developments lying to the rear of radial road development along Doddington Road and Newark Road. Post-war development has overwritten much of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s former landscape character, and as such few traces of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s past remain visible in the current townscape. The scale, density and layout of streets and houses is similar throughout much of the area. Many aspects of the townscape are strongly coherent across the whole Character Area, showing similar approaches towards the construction of housing in the latter half of the 20th century. In general houses are pain with simple, often structural decoration. The style decoration of houses varies slightly between each of the four residential developments, although houses are generally similar within each development unit. The style of some earlier houses are evocative of the art deco architectural style, whereas others reflect the austerity of the Post-war period.There is a fine overall grain of open space and buildings, with small buildings set within narrow rectangular plots throughout much of the Character Area. Large set backs, low public/private boundaries, consistent building height, medium to high building density, and wide residential roads with verges contribute to an open sense of enclosure for a suburb and a horizontal emphasis throughout much of the Character Area.Many houses have had features replaced, notably doors and/or windows replaced with uPVC substitutes and altered public/private boundaries.The area is divided in two by Tritton Road a bust and large-scale road, which was built in the Modern period. Houses within the area turn their backs on surrounding areas as well as Tritton Road in the centre of the Character Area resulting in a series of inward looking developments. Consequently views into and out of the area are restricted. A lack of connectivity between residential developments, with access typically restricted to a single road off one of the surrounding main roads, exacerbates the issue of connectivity both visually and physically. Rear garden fencing of properties backing onto the Tritton Road create a feeling of inactivity and lack of security along the road.Public space within residential parts of the Character Area is very limited.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 56,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,105,

07296767-c078-4016-b9e2-d9d01a505ecb,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,South Common Fringe Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSouth Common Fringe Character Area is located around the periphery of South Common and forms a transition between Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s rural hinterland and historic core. Buildings within the area face the common and form a prominent southern fringe and gateway to the city, which remains strongly Late Victorian/Edwardian in character. Views of both the south and north escarpments consolidate the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s role as a departure and arrival point to and from the city.The junction of St. Catherines, South Park, and High Street is a major transport node in the southern part of Lincoln, and has historically functioned as a gateway to the lower medieval city and the suburb of Wigford. The orientation of High Street and St. Catherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s follows the route of the Fosse Way, a road dating to the Roman Military Era.The Character Area is mainly residential, although several larger Late Victorian/Edwardian buildings are divided into apartments, or have been converted for use as offices, care homes, or hotel accommodation. The area also includes two schools and St. Catherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Church.Buildings in the Character Area illustrate the changing trends in the construction of middle- to upper-class housing in Lincoln during the Late Victorian/Edwardian and Post-War Periods. Properties face out across wide roads towards South Common, and roads are only developed on one side, emphasising the significance of building lines and resulting in a low overall building density and a low sense of enclosure.Late Victorian/Edwardian and Inter-War properties include individually built detached villas, semi-detached houses, short rows of attached houses and a small number of terraced houses. There is a clear relationship between building scale and the form and style of houses, with highly decorative detached properties and short rows of attached houses compared with plainer semi-detached and terraced properties. Larger or prominent buildings frequently retain a high degree of original features.Late Victorian/Edwardian properties vary in scale from two to six bays in width and two to three storeys in height. The changing scale of properties along streets is a characteristic of the area, and often serves to emphasise individual buildings within moderately strong building lines. The characteristic is particularly apparent where buildings respond to their prominent location on corners or terminating the views along streets.Modern residential properties include those within three small estates built during the Post-War and Modern Periods, and a small amount of modern infill all streets. Houses are comparably plainer and are mostly located to the rear of houses fronting main roads, except for the Eleanor Close development, which turns its back on the road.The Character Area includes a large amount of open green space, which strongly influences the character of the area and contributes to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s overall rural setting. The southern part of the Character Area, which is forms part of South Common, is a well-used event space. Other space includes wide roadside verges, a playground and a disused railway cutting.Wide roads in the area carry high volumes of traffic, and as such, the area is an important transport node and corridor in the south of Lincoln.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 15,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,88,

09218a50-d211-466a-b6d7-f9d28fd239c5,LARA RAZ AREA,,Franciscan Friary,"The four friaries of the major orders in Lincoln (Augustinian, Carmelite, Dominican and Franciscan) represent a good group by national standards, and in addition, Lincoln has a relatively rare example of a Friary of the Sack. The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In all four, of course, the churches and other claustral buildings will be of interest and plans need to be recovered, but we know a great deal about fraternal plans (e.g. Butler 1984) and attention should now be turning to more complex aspects of the archaeology of friaries. One of the new avenues requiring exploration is the study of burial populations at friaries; cemeteries will be of interest as valuable resources for paleo-pathology, but although we have a certain level of documentation about burials in the Lincoln friaries, we badly need a fully excavated graveyard to provide a proper sample. Some burials have been excavated under the Carmelite Friary, but it is not clear what percentage of the total they represent. These types of studies may be best targeted at the Austin Friary in Newport, which seems to be almost completely undisturbed. Consequently, any development proposals here should be accompanied by provision for the archaeological excavation of the complete church and burial ground. A similar opportunity may also exist at the Blackfriars, although the many reports of burials found here over the years suggest that this burial population may have been compromised already.We know more about the Lincoln Greyfriary than we do about the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s houses of the other major orders, though two major excavations within the precinct (LIN73a-c, GL91, GLA94 and GLB94) and through several studies of the surviving building, now belonging to the City and County Museum Service (Stocker 1984b).The layout of the site is quite well understood with a church standing to the north of a cloister in the centre of the site. A subsidiary cloister stood further south of the main buildings and attached to the south side of this latter cloister was the standing building. Although there has been some resistance to the idea, it is likely that the standing building functioned as the fraternal infirmary in both its original phase (of the mid 13th century) and in its reconstructed phase (of the later 13th century) (Ibid.). The building is a complex one, however, and future repair work on the building must be accompanied by detailed survey work aimed at refining, or even challenging the existing consensus (a useful series of measured drawings already exists in Padley 1851). Although the plan of the friary buildings requires further elucidation (especially the church itself), so much is known already that further work might profitably concentrate on other aspects of the complex. As was also the case with the Lincoln Carmelites and Dominicans, the Greyfriars of Lincoln were one of the premier houses within their order; three provincial chapters of the English Province were held here, but perhaps even more significant from the point of view of buildings on the site, three chapters of Premonstratensian Order of Canons were held here in the 15th century. Clearly, therefore, the monastery had exceptional accommodation, which could be rented out rather like a modern conference centre and this might imply an exceptionally well- appointed ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáouter court‰Û¡ÌÝå», presumably near the gatehouse, both of which remain unexplored. Like the Dominicans, the Franciscans also interested themselves in the water supply and laid conduits into the city, which served both as a public supply and a supply for the house (Stocker 1990). This conduit was almost certainly along the southern boundary of the precinct and should be located and explored. In comparison with Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s other fraternal orders, the Greyfriars had a long precinct wall, which could have been exploited for commercial purposes. It had frontages on to Clewmarket (RAZ 9.23.1) to",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn around the presumed boundary of the precinct, bounded by the city wall on east and south, Free School Lane on the west, and Clewmarket on the north.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.53.4,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.53.4,

The churchyard is first mentioned in 1155-8 (ed. Foster 1931, 86-7, No.137), but by 1263 it was united with St Mary-le-Wigford, which parish was thenceforward to provide a curate (Hill 1948, 138). The parish, then, was only a viable ecclesiastical unit for a short period of time, presumably in the later 11th and 12th century. These impoverished peripheral churches are just as interesting as the larger more prosperous ones, however, not least because they provide short periods of occupation allowing more closely dated understanding of changing practices. In this case the impact on the performance of rituals before and after the transfer of the parochial centre to St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s will be a matter of considerable interest. Similarly the graveyard will not have been in operation over a great length of time, and therefore the burial population may provide a very valuable sample perhaps within a narrow date-bracket. Burials may not have stopped at the church in 1263 (although that is possible). In its topographical location St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is also of interest. It may have been founded to serve a discrete urban estate on the hillside, laid out along either side of Danesgate. However, Danesgate potentially marks the eastern boundary of the early ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáHigh Market‰Û¡ÌÝå» (RAZ 9.22), and so St Andrews might also be considered as a foundation to serve one of the areas of market stalls, as we suspect was the case with churches such as St Cuthbert, St John-the-Poor and St Peter Stanthaket.",Summary,"The site of the graveyard was said by Edward Willson to be represented by a plot of land still in the possession of St Mary-le-Wigford in 1823 (Lincoln Cathedral Ms Portfolio K, f27).

It appears not to be mentioned until c.1260 (ed Foster 1933, 117, No.402) when a grant to an anchoress at the church is made. This anchoress‰Û¡ÌÝå» circumstances are of very great interest and should be recoverable archaeologically. The church was probably founded earlier, however, and the circumstances of its foundation are likely to be of great interest. We should ask if its foundation had anything to do with the establishment of the fishmongers' market on this part of the hill, within the High Market (RAZ 9.22). We have seen that many Lincoln markets had a church associated with them and in some cases (like St John in Newport - RAZ 9.60.1) the church may have been founded at the same time that the market was laid out. St John-the-Poor might therefore have been the church of the fishmongers, founded to cater for the newly created settlement established when the fishmongers' temporary booths in the High Market became permanent houses (RAZ 9.22). In turn, this may suggest that it was founded by a group of merchants coming together rather than by a single lord. If it belongs in this category, then St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s should be compared directly with St Cuthbert (RAZ 9.60.37) and St Peter Stanthaket (RAZ 9.60.36).",Summary,"The site of the churchyard can be partly reconstructed. The south boundary is known to have been formed by the terrace wall behind St Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Terrace (a section of churchyard deposits was seen when this wall collapsed in 1983). The west and north boundaries will have followed the line of the lane which formerly ran diagonally across the hillside from the north end of Beaumont Fee towards the south gate of the upper city. It is not known, however, whether this boundary ran alongside the lane or whether there was a row of houses between it and the churchyard.

0b5634e4-1af6-4f34-addd-4829d77ab359,LARA RAZ AREA,,Newland market,"Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s study of the layout of the streets to the west of the Newland gate shows that, at a relatively late stage in the development of the street pattern, a substantial market place had been inserted into this suburb (chapter 9a; RAZ 9.19). The market place is a long narrow rectangle, placed east to west and with roads entering three of the four corners. In this respect it resembles many market places in surrounding villages and towns, but it is the only regular space of this type within the city. Although it is clearly an insertion into the earlier townscape, its absolute date remains unknown. It should be possible to arrive at a date through archaeological investigation, however, either within the (presumably newly laid-out) properties along its sides, or alternatively work along the original lines of Midhergate or Carholme Road north and south of the market may indicate when these streets were diverted. On present evidence, the market may represent another foundation of the 14th - 16th centuries, like those at Newport and St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Croft, and, like those other markets, it may have been a measure by the City Council to stimulate trade in the suburb (RAZ 10.31). It was dominated by the Buttercross, which was apparently placed towards its east end and formed some type of shelter (as it was subsequently moved to the churchyard of St Peter-at-Arches to protect the relocated market there from the elements- Hill 1956, 202 - which it did until it was taken down in 1572). It might prove possible to relate the date of the cross to the date of the establishment of the market, in that the newly established market may well have been marked with such a cross. The first reference to the cross is not until 1507 (ed. Foster 1914, 35; Cameron 1985, 19), but it was evidently a well-known feature by then. Even so, market crosses which are also shelters for the traders are a well-known category of late-medieval structure (cf. stone examples at Chichester, Malmesbury and Salisbury, all dated between 1490 and 1510). On the presumption that the Lincoln Buttercross was a structure of this type, and that the cross dates from shortly after the foundation of the market, we can suggest that the Newland Market was a late medieval superimposition into the streetscape and therefore probably belongs to the Early Modern city landscape rather than to that of the High Medieval Era. According to Venables (1888b, 61), the city pillory was also set up within the market place, and it would be consistent for such a facility to have been installed when the market was founded.As the market seems to be a late superimposition into the townscape, deposits which predate it will be usefully sealed beneath a horizon of whatever date. This may be especially valuable along the south of the market place, where earlier medieval buildings which fronted on to the north side of the original line of Carholme Lane should be better preserved (in the back yards of the buildings which front on to the market space) than many buildings of these dates in the city - cf. also RAZ 9.31. These properties along the north side of the former line of Carholme Road could be distinctive anyway; it is possible that, rather than lining a conventional street, they lined the north side of a road that opened directly on to the river frontage facing Brayford. There is no documentation suggesting any quayside activity here in the late medieval period, but the possibility that the north side of the Brayford was used as a landing place during the 11th and 12th centuries should not be ruled out.",Summary,"The RAZ for the market includes the broad street itself, with the intention of managing deposits and structures related to the market itself.

0b666db2-efc6-4ef3-a933-1896d813b3df,LARA RAZ AREA,,The churches of St Peter and the Silver Street burial,"The evidence for activity inside the former Roman south gate of the lower city is slight, but potentially of very great importance. The evidence is restricted, on the one hand, to the discovery of a small group of Anglo-Saxon interments at the Silver Street excavations and, on the other, to the suggestion that there was an early church site in this vicinity. The latter proposal, which has been made by a number of scholars (most recently by Richard Gem - 1993) is that the two medieval churches dedicated to St Peter, which stood in the same churchyard on the corner of Silver Street and High Street, were founded in the pre-Viking period. Possibly, it is argued, they stood on the site of the known Episcopal church, founded a century after Paulinus‰Û¡ÌÝå» conversion of Blaecca, in the 720s. Although the two independent observations have been placed within the same RAZ, and they may well be related to each other, there must remain, some doubt, however, whether both sites represent the same phase of activity in the lower city. The reports of the excavations at Silver Street (LIN73a-e) make it clear that at least one of the inhumations cut into the hypocaust of the former Roman building on the site were in a posture approaching the classic ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácrouched‰Û¡ÌÝå» position familiar from ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápagan‰Û¡ÌÝå» Anglo-Saxon burial grounds and these burials are, consequently more likely to have been made according to a pagan Anglo-Saxon rite than a Christian one. Although it has been suggested that these Silver Street burials were part of a hypothetical early monastery cemetery belonging to the churches of St Peter, the fact that these are crouched inhumations makes this less likely. If it is accepted that the earliest (i.e. pre-hanging-bowl) graves at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s are of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáConversion period‰Û¡ÌÝå», then these burials at Silver Street could be contemporary, and they might lie on the eastern fringe of a similar graveyard sequence to that at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, which subsequently (i.e. post-Conversion) became the St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. In other words, the Silver Street graves could represent a second case of an Anglo-Saxon burial ground initially using a pagan rite, which became more recognisably Christian in the pre-Viking period, perhaps this time in the 8th century, when the Episcopal church was founded. These observations about the early reuse of Roman ruins as burial grounds both here, at Greetwell Villa and St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, prompts the general research proposal that, wherever the outline of a major Roman building is known the interior space or spaces defined by its walls should be carefully searched for evidence of Anglo-Saxon burialsThe evidence for a pre-Viking Episcopal church on the sites of St Peter at Pleas and St Peter at Arches is confined to the record, probably made by Bede, of the inscription which once decorated its apse (Everson and Stocker 1999, 306-7). Unfortunately although the inscription says that the church is in a city (urbs) it does not say which city this was, and, although it says that the church is dedicated to an Apostle, it does not say which one. Although a case can be made that the city in question is a spiritual one (such as the monastery at Bardney - Stocker 1993), the consensus of opinion is that it is more likely to be in Lincoln. Furthermore, although at first sight the mention of an apostolic dedication might seem to rule out St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and point strongly towards the two St Peters, unfortunately St Paul was also counted as an apostle in the early medieval period (Cross 1957, 72). Even though the evidence for this early medieval site is so slight, however, the early dedication form, the presence of two churches in the same churchyard and the central location within the lower city, as well as the documentary background to the medieval churches (Hill 1948, 130-1), all point towards St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s being an early, probably pre-Viking, church site. Set in such a contrasting location to St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s it offers important possibilities for comparison. Was this the",Summary,"The boundaries of this RAZ are very difficult to establish. The southern boundary of the presumed Silver Street graveyard is likely to be the Roman south wall of the city, whilst the western boundary could have been along the line of the Roman High Street, but it is also possible that it ran along Mint Lane, for which a Roman origin is suspected and which is, perhaps, the western boundary of the Roman temple precinct (RAZ 7. 20). The eastern boundary may be represented by the Roman north-south roadway which seems to have lasted into the High Medieval Era. We have no indication of the northern boundary. It is unlikely to be south of the northern boundary of the former churchyard of St Peter at Pleas, but it could lie anywhere to the north of this. It might be worth observing, however, that the rectangular spaces created by the four boundaries suggested for this RAZ enclose a space of similar area to that proposed for the site at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,8.1.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,8.1.2,

0c186c31-6aed-43d4-a372-ba380578f078,LARA RAZ AREA,,Chemical industries,"Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s chemical industry was concentrated on a site between Carholme Road and the Fossdyke (Herridge 1999, No.5125). The site (formerly a ropewalk - RAZ 11.39) was occupied c.1837-1850s by William Singleton and John Jekyll, but it is not clear what work was undertaken at this early date. Further research on this site should address the question of whether or not these two investors began working in chemicals here, or whether the site was used for other purposes. From 1867 to 1920 the site was occupied by Jekyll, Glasier and Pratt, who produced feed-cake and calf meal as well as such agricultural chemicals as sheep dip under the ""Anchor"" trade-mark and other pest sprays and treatments. In 1920 the works were operated by Doughty Richardson Fertilisers Ltd. and in c.1950 this company became part of Fisons. The early development of the chemicals industry is closely related to the growth of fertiliser production and it is quite likely that works such as Singleton and Jekyll would represent an early example. Presumably the site was originally supplied with raw materials such as potash via the canal, although, given the suggestion that potash might have been produced in the woodlands south-west of the city in earlier Eras (RAZ 9.6, 9.10, 10.6, 10.10) we might ask if some of their supplies were local. Any information about the beginnings of chemical production here will be of great interest, nationally as well as locally. We should also be interested in the development of chemical and fertiliser production here - a research agenda for the such processes is given in the Step 1 Report (Cranston 2000). The role of fertilisers in the dramatic growth of Lincolnshire‰Û¡ÌÝå»s arable agriculture is yet to be fully explored by archaeologists, but it is clear that fertiliser was an extremely important commodity. This means that, by linking developments at the factory site to developments in the county‰Û¡ÌÝå»s arable production, we may be able to tell whether this plant was producing for a local, national or international market. It is clear, for example, that the railways also became important for the plant, as much for exporting their products as for importing raw materials, and by c.1920 the factory was connected to the rail network by a private siding passing over the Fossdyke by a drawbridge (Herridge 1999, No.5074). An industrial building of c.1850 still stands and this must be recorded during the process of repair and alteration, with the main aim of understanding its role in the process, which is not understood at present.The Stokes Coffee Warehouse, Mint Lane (Herridge 1999, No.5046) might also have been built by Tomlinson and Hayward, chemicals manufacturers (Herridge 1999, No.5474). It is a large warehouse of the 1860s. Future recording work here, undertaken in association with repair or alteration should focus on identifying and understanding any specialised details within the building‰Û¡ÌÝå»s fabric or represented by its original fittings, which might help define its original function more closely.",Summary,The RAZ elements are mapped following the sites‰Û¡ÌÝå» depiction on the 1889 O.S. map editions and including a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.43,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.43,

0c2ddd25-f8f4-4c54-9274-5705c746734c,LARA RAZ AREA,,Sincil Dyke,"The Sincil Dyke watercourse (RAZ 10.51.5) functioned as a defensive barrier and was a natural property boundary during this Era but there seems to be no record of it having been used to transport goods (Herridge 1999, 26, No.5360). It leaves the Witham at Altham Terrace, flows east under Bargate Bridge, and Little Bargate bridge, before turning north along Sincil Bank. Since c 1500 the watercourse had re-joined the Witham near Stamp End. This junction was itself closed off in the late 18th or early 19th century and the Dyke was continued further east, parallel and south of the Witham, as the South Delph. This may have taken place in 1770 or in 1810-20 (Mills 2001b, 136), but the precise date and the circumstances under which it occurred are important research questions which should be addressed in future work. Were they, for example, related to the establishment of Shuttleworth‰Û¡ÌÝå»s boat yard on the north bank? The east turn at Sincil Street was changed (the corner being smoothed out into a gentler curve) between 1817 and 1842 but the reason behind this major engineering task is uncertain. Could this have been done to make it easier to haul barges along the Dyke? If so this might imply that the early foundries on Waterside North used this route for transport and, consequently, we should be interested in the length of time that Sincil Dyke might have been used as a transport waterway. Did use by the Waterside South foundries cease shortly after the arrival of the railways? If the Dyke was used for water transport we need to understand how barges negotiated the sluice and weir at Altham Terrace. Was the junction with the Witham originally provided with a pound lock? Large-scale deepening, reconstruction of the bed and banks in concrete, and replacement of the bridges and handrails on Sincil Bank took place in 1963-4.The development of water-control techniques can be studied in the banks of the Sincil Dyke and, especially where isolated lengths survive unaltered, (such as the section under Norman Street), a sequence of development can be assembled. These techniques should reveal whether or not the dyke‰Û¡ÌÝå»s banks were ever intended for use as a mooring, and any such evidence would suggest, of course, that the dyke was used for transport as well as for water-control. The back-filled stretches of the dyke itself, and the back-filling between newly installed bank-sides and their predecessors offer, not only dating evidence for the construction work, but also an unrivalled prospect of large deposits of waterlogged material from the 18th- and 19th-century city discarded as rubbish. The Lincoln West drainage scheme of 1804-16 (Herridge 1999, 14, Nos. 5373 & 5380) (RAZ 11.13; 11.4.2), which was aimed at draining a large tract of land west of Wigford and south of the Brayford Pool and the Fossdyke, involved the construction of two new drains east to west across the carr land north of the village of Boultham. The northern of these joined the old Gowts Drain (RAZ 11.4.2), but the southern one connected with the western end of Sincil Dyke, where it joined the Witham. This drain, however, was a continuation of the Prial Brook aimed at diverting its water from emptying into the wetland around Swanpool towards the Witham. At Gowts Drain the new dyke was carried in a culvert below the Witham (RAZ 11.4.2), but at Sincil Dyke the 1842 Padley map shows a junction of channels and a weir. Subsequently there were flood control measures installed at the western end of the new dyke, although it is not known when. As with the northern of the two new drainage dykes the original techniques used for constructing its banks will be of some interest, especially if they involved hard bracing, and along their lengths the remains of weirs, locks, valves or other features would be of considerable technical interest.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn along the lines of the dyke‰Û¡ÌÝå»s banks through the land east of Wigford. Along the Sincil Dyke itself the line is drawn along the line of the original dyke to the north and along the line of the modern dyke to the south.

0c38ebd2-bff7-470a-bd1c-b9cfbe5963bd,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Newport,"What evidence we have for the Newport suburb suggests that from the 14th to the 18th century it suffered a period of almost continuous decline. No doubt the re-establishment of the market here in 1330 (RAZ 9.16, 10.16) was an attempt to halt this inexorable process, but in the long run it seems to have been unsuccessful. This pattern of decline does not mean that the archaeology of the suburb is without interest, however. We need much more information about the process by which the community which was established around the market street turned its back on the street and went out into the surrounding fields to make its living. This process of conversion should be visible in the plan forms of the buildings lining the original market. It is possible that some of the properties along the street always contained an agricultural component, but, equally, it is also possible that groups of properties aligned on the market place were engrossed into rural-looking agricultural units from the 14th century onwards.

Gibbons 1888, 183), nonetheless the church was closed by the Act of Union of Parishes in 1549 and the parish merged with St Michael. Along with St Andrew-under-Palace (RAZ 10.60.35) the church was one of the two involved with the guild of 'St Mary who looks over Little St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå» and this may point to the location of an important subsidiary altar in the church (Westlake 1919, 166-75). St Cuthbert‰Û¡ÌÝå»s then offers an important opportunity to see the structure and layout of a church on the eve of the Reformation, but presumably before any iconoclasm had taken place. It may, therefore, help in addressing questions about whether the Old Religion was in decline, or whether, in fact, it had widespread popular support (Duffy 1992). The manner in which the fabric was treated at demolition should be assessed to see if it provides any contrasts with earlier redundancies made before the Reformation.

The present fabric is merely the eastern part of the medieval church (the choir and adjacent chapel), but the tower (of 17th-century date) is built re-using masonry from the demolished nave. Fabric works to the church, but especially to the tower, need to be carefully monitored. In keeping with its location in an area of elite residences, in the later medieval period the church was the location for several important chantries (Thomas of Wigford, founded in 1318 but moved to the Bridge Chapel in 1330; Robert de Dalderby, founded 1352; Roger de Tateshall, founded 1378 - Venables 1887-8, 334; ed. Foster 1914, 44). The ritual layout of these should be visible archaeologically and will be of interest, and we know of several other elite burials here in the late medieval period (eg. John Becke - Hill 1957, 93). These burials will provide important information about late medieval obsequies, and comparison between elite burials made either side of the Reformation may demonstrate differences in ritual and belief amongst the more prominent members of the Lincoln citizenry. Furthermore the church was the home to the Guild of the Purification of St Mary (Westlake 1919, 166-175) and this institution is likely to have had some impact on the late medieval liturgical layout of the church.The church is thought to have been damaged in 1644 (Hill 1956, 196), but the tower (presumably a west tower) did not fall down until 1674 and it may be that the nave also survived until then. The building may not have taken up its present form until 1701 (Hill 1948, 135). The archaeology of the nave, therefore, should demonstrate the important changes to ritual and layout undertaken at the Reformation, but without too much damage from later ecclesiastical re-orderings.",Summary,"The boundaries of the medieval churchyard are known and include a slightly larger area than those now maintained as a public open space.

A church was built in 1839-40 to the designs of the young architect G.G. Scott, who later said it was his first church. This means that the architectural design of the original building is important evidence for the development of the architectural ideas of one of our most eminent 19th-century architects. The building has not survived unaltered, however; the chancel and the north aisle were not added until 1909 (designed by C. Hodgson Fowler). The evidence for Scott‰Û¡ÌÝå»s original intentions both in terms of ground plan, architectural details and fittings will survive, however, and should be the target of recording work during alterations or repair. The ground plan is particularly informative - prior to Hodgson Fowler‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work the chancel was simple aedicule in the east wall, not at all the sort of thing of which the mature Scott would have approved, and it shows that, at a time when Pugin was starting to write about the symbolic significance of the church plan, Scott was still following established convention. St Nicholas‰Û¡ÌÝå» then stands to one side of most of the Anglican church building of the Industrial Era, it is earlier in date than most and belongs to a pre-Tractarian tradition. The churchyard may originally have been established around the church, although the churchyard on the old church site is perhaps more likely to have continued in use. But when that graveyard was closed in the 1850s, a new burial ground was designated to the north-east of the new church site. This cemetery grew enormously between 1850 and 1950 and there were several enlargements.

This area is now covered by ridge and furrow cultivation and this needs to be dated. At present there are competing theories as to when this ridge and furrow is likely to have laid out. Perhaps the most likely is that it represents an agricultural response to the increased pressure of population in the 13th century (RAZ 9.8.2) but it is also quite possible that the meadow was uncultivated in the High Medieval period and the ridge and furrow represents an early modern re-cultivation made prior to the Enclosure Award. The lost road called Cliffgate crossed the common diagonally from south-east to north-west (RAZ 10.12.2). This road may be detectable as an earthwork, but it is likely to survive as an undisturbed archaeological feature. Its developing relationship with the different agricultural regimes on the common should be visible and needs to be investigated with some care in sections which include not just the road surfaces but the flanking ditches and a representative area of the adjacent common land. The common is likely to have been scattered with light-weight booths for herdsmen, but unfortunately, although any such survival would be of great interest, we cannot locate them from documentary sources and it is unlikely that one will come to light except through accident. Along the northern edge of the RAZ as defined here, it is likely that there will be routeways leading towards the quarries and clay pits in the cliff face (RAZ 10.41.1), but these cannot be located at present either.",Summary,"The RAZ has the same boundaries as RAZ 9.8.2, with the exclusion of RAZ 10.8.1.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.8.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.8.2,
0e2256cc-fd27-441d-9dad-20b1f65f3d25,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Upper Wigford (north of Great Gowt),"When considering the character of housing in Upper Wigford (RAZ 9.33) in the High Medieval period, we noted the high quality and status of both known and surviving buildings there, and from that, we developed the argument that this suburb was particularly favoured as a residential area by the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s mercantile and administrative elite. For the early modern period the archaeological questions to be addressed here must develop this debate. Despite the fact that two of the southernmost parishes (St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s) were reported as having fewer than 10 inhabitants in 1428, it seems that the tradition of many of the wealthiest merchants continuing to establish themselves in the suburb continued through the period of economic decline in the 14th and 15th century. Pre-eminently from that date we have the example of the Sutton family, a great merchant dynasty first established in the parish of Holy Trinity Wigford, who then built the magnificent stone house known as John of Gaunt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace at the end of the 14th century (Stocker 1999). The Suttons were evidently not unique, however, and other merchant families were also in residence (like the Knight family in St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish in the 15th century - Gilmour and Stocker 1986, 6). Surviving above ground from the late medieval period we have today only the impressive wing in Akrill's Court known as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáWhitefriars‰Û¡ÌÝå» (but in fact part of a major 15th- or early 16th-century merchants house) and the fragmentary remains of a similar range extending back from the street, belonging to a house of similar size, on the west side of the High Street at No.195 (Jones et al. 1990, 144). Against this background it is not surprising that the most impressive high medieval house of all - St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall - was converted for use as the headquarters of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s principal guild, and that it was not removed to be closer to the centre of the shrinking city before it was dissolved in 1549. It is likely, however, that some remains of early modern buildings have survived the 19th-century rebuilding, particularly in the gable walls and a careful watch should be mounted for such remains during repairs and reconstructions. These major late medieval houses represent the prosperity of Lincoln following the collapse of the cloth trade. They were the Lincoln houses of merchants who, although based in Lincoln, did most of their trading elsewhere, in the Staple at Boston or Calais. Presumably, although their household expenditure was an increasingly important component in the city economy, their activities did not bring much large-scale trade. A full investigation of any of these grand late medieval properties would be highly desirable, not just to establish the layout of such houses, but especially to judge the level of contact between such households and far flung trading posts in the artefact assemblages.The tradition that Upper Wigford was the home to many of the wealthiest of Lincoln citizens outlived the middle ages and, for example, the most impressive new house of the 17th century outside the Close was probably Bromhead House, which stood opposite the Unitarian Chapel until demolished in 1904. Somewhat later in date, and slightly to the north, Marchmont House (363 and 364 High Street) still survives; its rusticated quoins show that it was not part of a continuous street front when built. Similarly, the most ambitious new house built outside the Close in the early 18th century was probably Sibthorpe House, which stood opposite St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Church (Gilmour and Stocker 1986,5-6) until demolished in 1962. The fabric of John of Gaunt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s house was continually adapted and altered throughout the period (it was not finally demolished until 1963) to bring it up to date, and we should presume that similar adaptations would have been made in many of the other houses lining the High Street. The remains of all of these buildings, whether buried or above ground are of great interest and should be fully investig",Summary,The boundaries of the RAZ follow those of RAZ 9.33,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.33,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.33,

The architectural development of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, like that of St Benedict, indicates a prosperous parish from the 11th century through to the 14th, when expansion ceases, leaving the church without architectural features of later date. The church fabric, then, seems to act as a barometer for the economic fortunes of the city as a whole. In fact this impression is somewhat illusory as we know from wills that St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s continued to receive bequests from wealthy citizens and some of those bequests were made to the fabric (for example the will of Robert Appleby left money to the fabric in 1407 - ed. Gibbons 1888, 107) and we have evidence for a sequence of elite burials here throughout the late medieval period. The architectural structure and details of the church are worthy of study in their own right, and any alterations to the fabric must be accompanied by a detailed archaeological record, but such studies should also be seen against the wider economic, social and ritual background of churches in the city. Although it may be that constant use in more recent times has obliterated buried evidence for liturgical re-ordering at the Reformation, nevertheless the fabric itself will show the locations of fixtures and fittings and these features will be revealed by close fabric study. Unusually in a Lincoln church, there will also be evidence in the fabric of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s for the fittings belonging to liturgical changes made during the 17th and 18th centuries, and the understanding of these should also form part of future research designs.To the south of the modern church a portion of the graveyard has been adopted by the railway. This was an interesting area of the graveyard because it is another example (like those at St John Wigford 9.60.23 and St Botolph 9.60.21) of a rectory which may have been built within the churchyard. Although evidence for the (timber-framed) rectory structure may have been destroyed by the railway, several views of it survive, and it is of interest in its own right as another early modern Lincoln building, in comparison with other secular buildings in the suburb and elsewhere (RAZ 10.33 and RAZ 10.34 etc) and specifically with the church houses at St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Botolph (RAZs 10.60.21 and 10.60.23).",Summary,The boundary of the graveyard is known from early mapping and the RAZ includes its whole extent.

0ec7ba5e-5c90-4e00-975b-f9eb444ef4b5,LARA RAZ AREA,,Common quarries in the cliff faces north-west and south of the city,"The limestone, ironstone, gravel and clay which outcrops along the cliff edge north-west of the occupied area of the city were important natural resources for the people of the early modern city, as they must have been for all who came before them (RAZ 7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.14, 9.41.1, 9.41.2). Although there is said to be some earthwork evidence for diggings at the northern end of the modern West Common (pers. com. P Everson), and the earthwork remains of quarrying on South Common are very evident, there is little documentary evidence to establish the date of these features. From the continuing use of Lincoln stone in early-modern building projects, both in Lincoln and the vicinity, however, we can be sure that the stone continued to be prized and used, so we should ask why this important industry has left little documentary record. One reason for this lack of documentation might be that quarrying (both for stone and other materials) was not organised on an institutional basis. Such working is, after all, what we might expect in the cliff faces north-west and south of the city, which are known to have been parts of the common-land of the city. Although there is little documentation for the practice, then, it may be that the citizens extracted stone and clay as part of their common rights in these areas.This issue can be reviewed archaeologically, as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon diggings‰Û¡ÌÝå» and are likely to have a completely different character compared with commercially owned and managed workings. Future archaeological explorations in these areas, then, should aim at establishing how large each winning was, and estimate whether it had been opened and worked by a single individual, or family, rather than by a commercial or institutional operation. The techniques used for such ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon diggings‰Û¡ÌÝå» will also be of considerable interest, especially if they can be compared with technology employed in larger-scale, more commercial, quarrying (for example RAZ 9.41.2). A research agenda for stone quarrying has recently been issued (LUAU 1996a).It is simply not known whether the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáNorthamptonshire Ironstone‰Û¡ÌÝå» below the building stone was also quarried in these common areas, or, if it was, how the resulting ore was then smelted. It is not impossible that small-scale smelting operations would have been set up by groupings of commoners nearby, and the remains of such facilities should be searched for in the archaeological record. However, as yet we have no documentary or archaeological evidence to call on in locating any such installations. A research agenda for ironstone mining has been issued (Crossley 1994; Instone 1995).Similar research questions to those aimed at understanding stone-winning can also be addressed in future work on the clay diggings on the commons, which lie below the stone-winning in the cliff face. Some documentary evidence that clay digging on the South Common was indeed a commoners right is implied in the proposal from the City Council in 1742 that such diggings should be (re)established to supply the new demand for bricks (Hill 1966, 139 and n). The fact that the Council felt that they had the power to issue such an order suggests that quarrying rights here were indeed organised as part of the common rights of the city. Clay-pits below the line of mills on West Common were mentioned in 1581, but little seems to be known about how they were managed (Hill 1948, 334).We should be looking for archaeological evidence in the cliff faces both north-west and south of the city, for evidence of small-scale, individual, clay-digging consistent with the exploitation of common rights, rather than larger more organised workings, which might suggest operation by commercial concerns. A research agenda for clay digging and preparation has been issued (Simcoe 1998). Facing South Common we know of a long-lived tile house in St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish (RAZ 9.40, 10.40), which must have used clay from the diggings on the common and may, therefore, also",Summary,"The RAZ is in two parts and the boundaries of both parts are governed by the likely presence of the raw materials being exploited. Stone quarrying at the top of the cliff means that the RAZ boundary runs along the tops of the cliff in both southern and northern parts of the RAZ. The clay digging occurred towards the base of the cliff, but ancillary operations, such as stone cutting, lime-burning, iron-smelting or clay preparation are likely to have extended on to the flat land in the valley floor. We should note that the Burghwarmote Book contains references to limekilns to as far back as 1334 (Cameron 1985, 177), and one of these is presumably the kiln which is said to be ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáthe common kiln‰Û¡ÌÝå» for lime-burning in the mid-16th century (Hill 1956, 83). Unfortunately we have no information about this kiln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (or these kilns‰Û¡ÌÝå») location. The RAZ boundary at the base of the cliff therefore extends (in the case of the South Common) as far north as Sincil Dyke and (in the case of the West Common) as far south as edge of the hard land defined by the boundary of RAZ 9.7. The other boundaries of the southern part of RAZ are governed by the District Council boundary, and so is the north-western boundary of the northern part. The south-eastern boundary of the northern part of the RAZ is drawn along the line of the city wall, to the east of which there was probably never any communal quarrying, even if small-scale workings were undertaken by individual property owners.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.41.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.41.1,

0fd31c7f-83e0-4a3e-a50b-b4a8186d5745,LARA RAZ AREA,,Newport 'farm',"The Newport 'farm' is probably a representative of a common site type, but it is a particularly important example nationally because of its close proximity to the city. Clearly it could either be viewed as an element within the territorium, and therefore presumably run by and for the city, probably being owned by either a single family or a consortium of city dwellers, (in other words a 'villa' - Millett 1990, 91). Alternatively, this might have been a holding owned and run by outsiders, attracted to the location because of the commercial opportunities presented by the proximity of the city markets (a 'fundus' or farm - ibid.). Both of these hypotheses should be approached through detailed analysis of the finds from the area and their comparison with equivalent collections of finds within the city and the county more widely. Mr Jones points to the potential value of comparing finds from this site with those from the more marginal strip buildings in Wigford, whose occupants may also have been involved in part-time agriculture (chapter 7a). Environmental work here has already proved useful in assessing the agricultural produce which was processed and stored here, and future work will need to make full use of environmental techniques. An environmental study might seek, however, not just to record activity within the farm complex itself but, especially around its boundaries, in order to establish whether the farm stood within its own group of arable fields, or whether it was surrounded by grazing land. Finally, as this site has also produced pottery of the Military period (RAZ 6.17), it offers the most unusual prospect of a real understanding of the impact of the departure of Legions on the local rural economy.",Summary,The boundaries of this RAZ are drawn along the same lines as in the Military Era (RAZ 6.17); i.e. it is based on the discovery of early occupation debris in excavations at Bishop Grosseteste College. It is likely that the settlement features represented will be adjacent to the road and are unlikely to extend more than 100m away from it.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.7,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.7,

1042f299-2fd9-416d-923b-51bd12a2019e,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Alexandra Terrace Character Area,"""Alexandra Terrace Character Area is a coherent residential area lying half way up the north escarpment consisting almost entirely of terraced houses dating to the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period.The layout of streets and form of houses is strongly influenced by the escarpment slope. Houses have a strong repeating form along streets, which is often emphasised by the rise and fall of the hill slope. Terraced houses have a consistent height, creating a strong horizontal building line along east/west streets, and a vertical stepped pattern of roofs and faÌÎå_ades along roads running up/down the escarpment. Houses have comparably lower solid-to-void ratios of frontages facing south than those facing north, and there is a preference for the construction of buildings with south facing faÌÎå_ades. Elevation and southerly prospects also appear to have an influence on the intended social standing of properties along Yarbrough Road, which are more varied in character.Rows of terraces form continuous lines along streets, and are an amalgamation of several development units, which vary from single properties to up to 34 houses. Different development units are most easily differentiated by decorative features, which are often particular to a build unit. The regular building height, elevated buildings along the northern side of roads, narrow streets and continuous building line result in a regular and strong sense of enclosure along streets.Properties are mostly two bays in width, although some have shared or side entrances. A small number of properties along or near Yarborough Road are three bays in width.There are apparent differences between north-facing and south-facing properties. Houses are two storeys in height, but extend to three storeys to the rear of houses facing north. The majority of houses along the north side of roads are set back 2-3m from the footway with raised gardens, whereas houses along the south side of streets are set at the back of the footway. South-facing houses are comparatively more decorative, with bay windows and a higher amount of moulded brickwork.Despite differences, houses within the Character Area have many similar attributes. Properties occupy the full width of their plot, and are mainly one-and-a-half in width with active frontages facing the street. Houses are brick-built in either English or Flemish Bond, and have gabled roofs with ridgelines parallel to the road. Roofs are mainly of Welsh slate, although many have been re-roofed using concrete tiles. Chimneys on the gable ends avoid the ridgeline. Properties have vertical windows with cambered or segmental brick arched lintels and stone sills. Decorative features on properties are often accentuated in a different coloured or moulded brick.Many properties show evidence of alterations, notably re-fenestration with uPVC windows, rendering or painting of faÌÎå_ades, replacement of doors in wood or uPVC.Two rendered properties at 30/32 Victoria Street may have been heavily altered. The houses have hipped roofs, uPVC doors and windows, and inactive frontages facing the street resulting in a high solid-to-void ratio and a feeling of inactivity.There are a small number of houses dating to the Inter-War and Modern Periods, which are similar to terraced houses in form, but differ according to the extent of decoration, position on plot, and relationship to the street.Streets are narrow two-car width tarmac carriageways with narrow 1-2m wide tarmac or concrete paved pavements with concrete kerbs and channels.

As we have noted (RAZ 9.60.24), the Blyton family chantry was founded at the altar of St Clement in the church in the mid 14th century (Hill 1948, 152, 168) and for as long as that family held Blyton Place, which was somewhere adjacent, the church would not lack a patron. The chantry should be visible archaeologically and the study of its remains might allow one to say whether similar patronage had been received from other families. The subsidy collectors reported that there were more than 10 inhabitants in the parish in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287), and the fact that the church was not dealt with by the city until 1550 suggests that it was still a viable building at the Reformation, but, nevertheless, it was one of those liquidated for the profit of the city in 1550-1 (HMC 1895, 44).

Coincidentally this site had also briefly been the site of the city Grammar School in the 16th century (RAZ 10.66). The original building, facing Monks Road, was a striking Flemish design (by George Sedger of London). In 1901 the school was handed over the City Corporation and the institution grew to the extent that a major extension was commissioned from William Watkins in 1906. A second major extension was undertaken in 1932. From the start the emphasis was on specialist teaching, with many teaching laboratories, and the school was well supported by local industry, which expected to use its products. The layout of the 1901 building and the 1906 rebuilding, in particular, will provide valuable physical evidence of the importance of science within the curriculum and a careful study of the plan may reveal details of how the new workshops and laboratories for subjects such as engineering were laid out. The 1932 extension also included new laboratories and workshops and a comparison with their predecessors of 1906 should illustrate the great advances in technical education following the First World War. The school subsequently went on to broaden its curriculum and develop into a general grammar school known as The City School.",Summary,The RAZ boundary is mapped following the site‰Û¡ÌÝå»s depiction on the 1907 O.S. map and includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.56,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.56,

1117e1c1-2619-4880-b630-2b7bb055a1bf,LARA RAZ AREA,,Upper Ermine Street,"In the colonia period, the Wigford causeway was clearly an important commercial artery supplying the commercial settlement in the lower city. However, Ermine Street continued northwards beyond the settled area. First it crossed an area containing a variety of major ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» buildings including a temple complex, and it may have therefore served a special ceremonial role in this vicinity. Then it approached the south gate of the upper city in a straight line, creating as it approached the walls, an impracticably steep ramp, which was partly managed through grand flights of steps. As Mr Jones points out (chapter 7a), this part of Ermine Street can hardly have been a commercially viable entrance route into the upper city. The main route into the upper city must always have been via the hill slope to the east, and in through what was clearly the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌámain‰Û¡ÌÝå» gate. Why, then, the need for a route entering the south gate at all? Utilitarian explanations would stress the length of the detour involved for goods travelling from the lower slopes of the hill round by the east gate route, and such arguments also lead to the proposal that the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌázigzag‰Û¡ÌÝå» formed by the modern streets called Well Lane and Danesgate. However, there may be other aspects to the direct route up the hill, additional to explanations stressing functional transport needs. We have seen in other RAZs (RAZ 7.11.1, 7.15, 7.16, 7.17, 7.18) that, within the colonia, most (if not all) of the walled upper city functioned as a group of interrelated ritual sites (temple complexes, baths and the houses of those associated with them). Mr Jones also hints that the south wall of the upper city may have remained intact even after the construction of the wall around the lower city had rendered it functionally redundant. In these circumstances, with the upper city being viewed more as a reserved enclosure, a ritual site, consisting principally of the temple of the Imperial cult, it may be more instructive to see the upper parts of the road approaching the enclosure from the south as a ceremonial way, perhaps continuing a ceremonial role it had fulfilled within the temple complex to the south (RAZ 7.20). The road climbing the hill towards the temple complex of the imperial cult, therefore, is not just leading from a commercial settlement towards its sacred site, but it is linking two sacred sites together. Furthermore, given our identification of the possible importance of water symbolism within Lindum, it may be that one purpose behind the road was to provide a structure around a continuation of the upper city ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásewer‰Û¡ÌÝå» system down the hill side. Any such sewer extension could be viewed as a practical matter of the disposal of waste water from the upper city into the river at the foot of the hill, or it could be viewed as the route by which the temples at the foot of the hill were supplied with a spiritually potent water supply, as might also have been the case with the Nemeton of Mars Rigonometos at Nettleham (RAZ 7.17). We must remember, however, that such explanations are not mutually exclusive, and the sewer system could well have served both practical and symbolic ends. It may not be safe, however, to presume that Ermine Street only acquired this additional ceremonial character once within the walled lower city- we have argued in (RAZ 6.2) that the initial construction of the Wigford causeway itself might have had a sacred or ceremonial character.The line of the road is known from extrapolation, validated through excavation. The RAZ is drawn to include a 10m wide strip on either side of the road to include any related roadside structures.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include both the estimated width of the road itself and a generous margin to capture relationships between the road and buildings that front on to it on either side.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.22,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.22,

117d32f2-a581-49d0-8001-1ca674e6a9e2,LARA RAZ AREA,,Greetwell villa estate and potential wic,"The third burial ground known from early medieval Lincoln is at the so-called Greetwell Villa to the east of the walled city. Unfortunately our information is confined to the observation by Precentor Venables, made during the course of destruction by stone-mining during the late 1880s, when he reported that ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásome human bones and portions of a human scull‰Û¡ÌÝå» were discovered within the ruins (Venables 1891, 51). Here, a long distance from the city, the burials are most easily explained as a third example of the same colonisation of prominent former Roman sites by early Anglo-Saxon burials to set alongside the remains from St Paul-in-the-Bail and Silver Street (e.g. Williams 1997 RAZ 8.1.1 & 8.1.2). The discovery of an early Anglo-Saxon pot on the site may indicate that cremation as well as inhumation was undertaken here and the pot is a rare example from a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌávilla‰Û¡ÌÝå» site (Eagles 1979, 166, 377-8). Even though so little is known about the early medieval use of the Greetwell Villa site, it is fair to point out that it appears to be an example of the same ritual behaviour evidenced more securely at both St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and the St Peters.This being so, we should ask why the site at Greetwell Villa did not also develop into a Christian churchyard. One possible answer is that this site was a long way from the walled enclosure, and relatively few such Villa sites, having been colonised by burials in the early or middle Anglo-Saxon periods, then developed into churches in later medieval periods (although some - like Lullingstone, Kent or Rivenhall, Essex, certainly did). It is just possible, however, that the Greetwell Villa did develop into a church site, but that the site of the church itself was relocated. The reason for proposing this lies not in our understanding of the Villa archaeology itself, which is minimal, but in the observation that the Greetwell Villa‰Û¡ÌÝå»s precinct seems to have survived intact from the Roman period into the 11th century. In the Roman Colonia Era we mapped a RAZ for the Villa precinct using the extents of known Romano-British burial grounds, and the RAZ (7.23) identified through this process turns out to have virtually identical boundaries with the monastic estate known as Monks Leys, which belonged to St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey York when first documented in the 11th century and which is defined very closely by a detailed survey of 1455 (RAZ 9.55.2). This apparent continuity in estate boundaries between the 4th and the 11th centuries, along with the fact that, in the 11th century, the site was in the hands of the premier abbey in northern England, might suggest that a factor such as the establishment of an early church site has gone unreported. By the 12th century the focus of this monastic estate was a cell located 500m to the south-west of the Villa itself, but the estate has very obscure origins. St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s acquired the estate from a certain Romfar of Lincoln, probably in the later 11th century (Hill 1948, 339), but we have no information about how he acquired it. Even so it is reported that there was already a church on the estate at that date. Famously, there was a tradition alive in Lincoln in the mid 16th century that the cell of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s represented the monastery mentioned by Bede and founded by St Botolph at Icanhoe. The evidence for this tradition comes from the report by Leland ‰Û¡ÌÝÌá- S. Beges, a late a celle to S. Mari Abbay at York: the which I take to be Icanno, wherwas an house of monkes yn S Botolphes tyme, and of this spekith Bede; it is scant half a mile from the minster‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Toulmin Smith, 1964, I, 30). Even though the evidence currently available is thin, then, there are a few hints that the Greetwell Villa estate might provide evidence for a third site to set alongside St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and the St Peters, where a Roman ruin was the focus for early Anglo-Saxon burials. The persistence of the Roman estate in the landscape, and the 16th-century tradition that the site represented Icanhoe, might also provide some sup",Summary,"The RAZ takes the same boundaries as the putative Roman estate defined as RAZ 7.23, but we must bear in mind the possibility that any wic site will probably have extended right up to the east wall of the Roman enclosure.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,8.1.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,8.1.3,

11cc0056-95a0-402a-9353-f408797609bc,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Carholme Road Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌCarholme Character Area is predominantly a residential townscape lying on the west side of Lincoln either side of Carholme Road, the main western entrance to the city. Much of the townscape is Late Victorian/Edwardian in character; however, several small areas have been re-developed during the Modern Period. Buildings in the area form part of a Late Victorian/Edwardian gateway in the west of the city, and have defined part of the transition between the city and its rural setting since the early 19th century.Much of the Character Area consists of rows of Late Victorian/Edwardian terraced houses arranged around a well-connected grid-like pattern of streets, orientated perpendicular and parallel to the overall gradient of the escarpment slope and Carholme Road. The form, scale and decoration of Late Victorian/Edwardian terraced properties are generally coherent within build units, which vary in size from individual properties to long rows occupying the full width of urban blocks. Variation in the decorative style of terraced houses within different build units is subtle, and is commonly expressed in the eaves decoration, on the door and window lintels and, to a lesser extent, in the use of brickwork patterns on the main faÌÎå_ade.Changes in scale and form of Late Victorian/Edwardian properties are a defining characteristic of the area, and underlie the staged development of the suburb as it expanded west as well as the more prominent locations within the area.Carholme Road is the dominant road in the Character Area, and the comparatively larger scale and more ornate residential properties along it, as well as a number of shops and services, reflect its prominent status. The character of buildings along its length is more changeable, with greater variation in scale, decoration and layout.Modern buildings in the Character Area consist of small areas of infill or redevelopment within the Late Victorian/Edwardian townscape. The form and style of developments varies; however, within build units, buildings are coherent in form and scale. Buildings take the form of short rows of houses, as well as larger-scale apartment complexes and commercial buildings. There are also a small number of Inter-War buildings that are typical of radial road development in the first half of the 20th century.The Fossdyke canal forms part of the southern boundary of the Character Area, and is a strong linear feature leading into the city centre. Late Victorian/Edwardian properties turn to face the water, respecting the prominence of the historic waterway and creating a feeling of activity along the canal‰Û¡ÌÝå»s north bank‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 7,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,36,

11d5e65d-d656-460c-a227-5e76e27742d2,LARA RAZ AREA,,Holy Trinity Clasketgate,"Holy Trinity has an important relationship with the Clewmarket (RAZ 9.23.1), as it is located at its western end. Dr Vince suggests that this market might have been of early origin, as early as the markets on the hillside for example, and, if this is so, Holy Trinity could be another example, like St John-the-Poor, St Cuthbert and St Peter Stanthaket (RAZs 9.60.34, 9.60.37, 9.60.36), which might have been founded through the efforts of a group of merchants trading in thread. The churchyard might, furthermore, be aligned on the east side of lower Flaxengate, which Dr Vince suggests is a component of the 10th-century grid of streets. On the other hand there are some reasons for thinking that the Clewmarket might be a later imposition into the townscape, perhaps dating from the 12th century and if this is so, we have to ask whether or not the church was here before the market. In these circumstances the church could have been another one of the marginal churches along the eastern side of the lower city which were probably founded by the lords of individual urban estates to cater for their tenants. In this second scenario, it is possible that it was the relative disuse of the church, or the large churchyard, which attracted the thread-merchants to do business here. Certainly the parish is likely to have been severely affected by the establishment and growth of the Greyfriars‰Û¡ÌÝå» precinct (staring in the 1230s - RAZ 9.53.4) which must have occupied much of it, and these events in the parish should be visible in the pattern of development of the parish church - and therefore in its archaeology.

1231c060-20c3-4c24-9fbf-b444fe54d96f,LARA RAZ AREA,,Lower City defences,"As with the upper city enclosure, we have no reason to doubt that the walls of the lower city were not also substantially still those of the Roman Era. They had been modified in the High Medieval Era, however, and the sequence of murage grants does not cease until 1371 (RAZ 9.50.1). Detailed study of the fabric of standing and buried remains of the walls will show us any Early Modern attempts to re-organise the defences, but we have few indications that any work of this type went on. The ditches were clearly abandoned long before the Civil War. The ditch along the east side of the lower city had become at least partly filled in by the early 17th century, when the street name Broadgate first appears (Cameron 1985, 54-5) and it is presumed that a similar sequence of events occurred along the west side. The fills of these ditches are likely to be of considerable interest. Episodes of the gradual accumulation of soil may suggest that, although they were not properly maintained, their integrity was nevertheless respected. On the other hand, episodes of dumping would indicate a deliberate intention to do away with them as defensive features. The material from these dumps is likely to be of considerable interest both for purposes of dating and for demonstrating the qualities of material culture inside the city, from where the dumps will have come. By the river it is likely that some of these dumps will be waterlogged offering important opportunities to recover organic materials.The final act in the re-edification of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s defences was the (partial) reconstruction of Stonebow, the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s south gate in 1390, but although the present structure is a complex one of several dates, its faÌÎå_ades are likely to belong to the reconstruction of 1520 (Stocker 1997b). It has been suggested that this final reconstruction has little to do with defence and is a building with a wholly symbolic intention. Repair work here must be accompanied by appropriate archaeological recording, aimed not just at elucidating the structural sequence but also the symbolic aspects of its design and decoration (for example in its interior decoration). Of the other lower city gates only Clasketgate gate is known to have seen much activity in the Early Modern Era. The possibility that it incorporated a later medieval doorway (suggesting a re-edification) has already been noted (RAZ 9.50.1) and it was ordered to be repaired in 1562 (Sympson 1906, 386). We also know that the large chamber over the gate served as the city magazine for periods in the 18th century and perhaps for some considerable time earlier (Hill 1966, 146). The buried remains of the gate lie beneath a complex road junction and any opportunity provided by the reconstruction of services within the road should be taken to produce a thorough study of the remains of this important structure. In addition to exploring the gate‰Û¡ÌÝå»s layout, any such study should examine the gate‰Û¡ÌÝå»s value as a symbol of civic power and pride - its eventual use for storing the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s armour would certainly be part of this symbolic panoply. The Buck view shows, for example, that the gables were ornamented with balls and obelisks of 17th-century date. We have no evidence that Newland Gate was altered between its construction (RAZ 9.50.1) and its demolition in the early 18th century. Nevertheless, it is likely to have been barred, at least temporarily, at times of civil emergency (as in the Civil War), and such evidence will be of great interest - particularly if related to a known event. Little or nothing is known about the west gate of the lower city (which lies under the modern road of West Parade), but here too we can propose that it would have served a number of public functions in addition to defence, and future work should aim to elucidate these.",Summary,The RAZ boundaries are drawn to include both the wall itself and a strip of land 40 metres wide to include the whole of the ditch. It is thought unlikely that there were any defensive structures apart from the Stonebow along the waterfront during the Early Modern Era..,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.50.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.50.1,

125c8ae9-af2f-426a-8686-e2682c249b60,LARA RAZ AREA,,Brayford‰Û¡ÌÝå»s northern waterside,"Both waterfronts of Brayford were rapidly developed as busy quaysides with warehouses following the re-establishment of the Fossdyke in the 1740s. Many of the warehouses built at this time were still standing in c.1945, although most have disappeared subsequently (Herridge 1999, Nos. 5499-5502). The buried remains of these warehouses are of archaeological interest as they offer an understanding of the diversity of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s trade, especially in the period prior to c.1850 when the waterways were the dominant trade route. The basic information about which warehouse dealt with which commodity may be comprehensible through documentary evidence, but the different plans of each warehouse will cast light on how the various commodities were treated. Changes in the layouts of the warehouses will hint at fluctuations in the trades in the different commodities over time, whilst through careful sampling it may be possible to say something about changes in the commodities themselves. It may also be possible to investigate whether there was any trade at the quayside itself, or was the marketing more strictly controlled so that goods were only sold through official outlets. Similarly it may be possible to say something about dockside installations. Were cranes or other machines employed or was loading and unloading done entirely by stevedores? If so, in what numbers?The 19th century saw consolidation of the wharves and building of bigger warehouses, flour mills, granaries, breweries and maltings, water transport depots, boat and barge builders, coal and timber yards, public houses and various offices and commercial dealers in agricultural and other products. This change in character from storage to food-processing buildings of different types may reflect the dramatic changes brought about by the arrival of the railways, and we should be investigating whether the changes from water-related canal warehousing to processing synchronise with the arrival of the railways. Commercial use of the north wharves may have declined after the growth and re-siting at New Boultham of the major engineering companies at the end of the century and the increasing dominance of railway transport. Pre-1945 surviving buildings consist of maltings (RAZ 11.38), electricity works (RAZ 11.45) and the Royal William IV public house on the North Wharf. All works to these important surviving buildings should be accompanied by recording programmes.At the western end the Corporation established a public wharf on reclaimed land and a comparison between the activity on the public wharf and that on the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» quaysides further east would be enlightening. Certainly there were problems with obstruction of the public wharves by private concerns; public access continued throughout the 19th century, but parts of it were acquired by the (still private) gasworks company between 1845 and 1883.A comparison between the warehouses on Brayford Wharf North and Brayford Wharf East will also be instructive - is it possible to say, for example, that one quayside was more likely to deal with imports and the other with exports?",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include the blocks of buildings fronting on to Brayford Wharf East as depicted on early mapping.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.2.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.2.2,

128ce009-acf2-4907-9b35-0c6a0098f8fb,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,West Common Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌWest Common is a large area of common land to the west of the city centre that is bisected by Saxilby Road. The proximity of this rural landscape to the centre of the city is a key characteristic of Lincoln. The Character Area forms a continuous swathe of open space reaching all the way from the agricultural areas on the boundary of the city to the city centre. From here there are wide views both towards the Cathedral and the profile of the north Escarpment, and out of the city into the grassland and agricultural land beyond. However, the latter is obscured in some places by the A46, which is raised on an embankment.The larger area of West Common, to the north of Saxilby Road, includes grassland grazed by horses, an area of grassland that used to be part of The Straight Mile of the Lincoln Racecourse, several plantations, a number of damper inundations, a formal pond and a range of sports facilities such as football pitches, bowling greens and tennis courts. The smaller area to the south is mainly short-mown grassland that has been used as a golf course since 1891.The Grandstand for the former Lincoln Racecourse is also situated on this side of Saxilby Road, facing on to the northern part of the Character Area. When racing meetings were held here, this section of the road was closed and traffic was diverted around the back of the building.During the High Medieval and Early Modern Eras much of the land in the Character Area and to the west of the city was held in ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon‰Û¡ÌÝå». Evidence for common cultivation, possibly as early as the High Medieval Era, can be seen in the series of ridge and furrow earthworks that remain.The early 19th-century enclosure and drainage of the area redefined the boundaries of this Character Area, particularly in the south and west, to its current shape. The racecourse was established by the Lincoln Corporation on West Common in 1773. It closed in 1964 but many vestiges of the track and associated infrastructure remain apparent in the Character Area, in particular the grandstand and stabling blocks which were constructed in 1897.The Common continued as a focus for recreation throughout the Early Industrial and Late Victorian/Edwardian Periods, with as many as twenty football pitches and eleven cricket pitches laid out. In 1874, public baths were constructed in the south of the area adjacent to the Main Drain, the brick walled remains of which survive in situ.During WWI much of the Common was designated No.4 Aircraft Acceptance Park and was used to test aircraft assembled in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s many industrial plants. The airfield had turf runways and a number of outbuildings, many of which survive as earthworks. Directly south of the grandstand there is an earthwork indicating the location of a former training trench in WW1.The topography of the Character Area is a gradual incline from south to north with the Fossdyke at the lowest point, Long Leys Road at the highest point and a levelled area in the centre accommodating Saxilby Road. The area also drops off slightly towards the east.The Character Area mainly contains improved grassland of low ecological value. However, there are also some exceptionally interesting and species-rich habitat types, namely: a large area of acidic grassland in the west where 3 holes of Carholme Golf Course are situated; a series of seasonally-inundated shallow depressions in the north-western part of the site; a hummocky area to the west, and two ponds.Numerous water features are scattered throughout this Character Area and run along its boundaries. The Fossdyke Canal, and the Catchwater and Main Drains, that run parallel to each other, bound it to the south and west. Several smaller drains and ditches cut across the golf course. There are two ponds, one each side of the road and a series of periodically inundated damp depressions. There are two clusters of leisure facilities, the sports pavilion on the northern side of Saxilby Road that is adjacent to the bowling greens, tennis courts and cricket pitch; and the grandstand building with its associated stable block on the southern side of the road. The grandstand is a focal point for the Character Area, as is the road with its avenue of trees, which has become increasingly busy in recent years. The view of the Cathedral, in particular, close by yet raised up on the north escarpment with the city leading up to it, is an important characteristic of West Common and Lincoln.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 82,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,20,

From 1873 the Bromhead Nurses were based in a hospital known as the Red House but they also went out to work in the local community, especially at the City Workhouse (RAZ 11.68) (Hill 1974, 153). Recording work in the present building (mostly of 1926 by the architect H.G.

12f9bcec-112b-43a3-a08b-225e6dfe6d9a,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,High Street Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe backbone of High Street Character Area is formed by High Street, a road that follows the alignment of the Roman ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáErmine Street‰Û¡ÌÝå», as well as roads leading off it, from the site of St. Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Church in the north to St. Mary-le-Wigford Church to the south. It is the main commercial centre of Lincoln and its townscape is the result of the ongoing, plot-by-plot development of the area since the Roman Military Era. High Bridge, at the centre of the area, has been a strategic bridging point over the River Witham since Roman times. The area has long reflected the changing fortunes of Lincoln the city, in particular times of relative economic prosperity and economic decline. Much of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s former High Medieval character is hidden with the current townscape, including the pattern of streets, churchyards and markets. On top of this structure lies an illustration of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economic growth since the Early Industrial period, including the most recent developments of the 21st century.Much of the character of the area is diverse and varied reflecting its plot-by-plot development and redevelopment of buildings and spaces along its length. Consequently, the area has one of the highest building densities in the city, giving emphasis and prominence to any open spaces as well as buildings which sit within open space. Despite the great variations of built form and streetscape, many of which reflect the fashions, materials, construction techniques and styles contemporary with their periods of construction, there are elementary congruencies as well as patterns that gel the variety of the Character Area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s constituents together. An example might be the prominence and individuality of buildings facing High Street, recognising the street‰Û¡ÌÝå»s long-held status as the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s premier retail space. The increased use of stone within buildings towards High Street is another manifestation of the long-held prominence of the street in comparison to surrounding areas.Shop fronts are a recurring feature of the area, and many have been repeatedly redeveloped as premises have adapted to the changing demands of the consumer. This has led to a division between ground floors and upper floors, which have changed comparatively less. This pattern is often reinforced by the subdivision of many larger properties into two or more retail units. Sustained development and redevelopment of the area has produced a highly complex townscape that illustrates the evolution of commerce in the city since the Roman period.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 90,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,56,

The buildings are of varied type, style, massing, height (e.g. two to ten storeys), and form. There are also surviving buildings, of a smaller scale from previous periods of development. The Character Area has a lively character, during both the day and night, with a variety of uses including commercial and leisure, and an educational use as part of the University of Lincoln. The marina, boat traffic, and the wildlife on the water all add to Brayford Pool‰Û¡ÌÝå»s distinctive character. The topography of the Character Area is flat.There are two distinct urban forms within the Character Area, both facing the waterfront: - the more dense Brayford Wharf North and Brayford Wharf East, and the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácampus-like‰Û¡ÌÝå» university south of the Brayford.Although much of the current townscape in the area is from the Modern Period the townscape is still strongly influenced by many earlier, and complex, developments, including the location of the Brayford Pool in prehistoric times, the building plots from the redevelopment of the waterfront in the Early Industrial Period, and the railway.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 57,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,59,

13a57227-c8b2-4e70-a2fc-6449e621e7d7,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,St. Peter's Avenue Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSt. Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Avenue Character Area is a residential area located on low-lying land at the base of the Witham valley adjacent to the Witham itself. The area consists of two public housing developments dating to the Inter-war and Post-war periods, each of which has a consistent and identifiable townscape character. Housing was developed on parkland belonging to Boultham Hall Estate, the remainder of which survives to the north of the Character Area. The former estate and subsequent housing development has overwritten the former rural character of the area, although some parts of the townscape still follow the alignment of former field boundaries. Mature trees, possibly once part of the designed landscape of the estate, survive in the area.The townscape is suburban in character, with several small open spaces in the form of verges and greens, which, alongside mature trees along many roads, create a spacious feeling. The majority of housing dates to the Inter-war period, and consists of short rows of four houses, a handful of rows of six or semi-detached houses. Properties are either bungalows or two storeys in height and two/three bays in width. There is a good sense of enclosure in Inter-war areas provided by narrow streets, consistent 5-10m setback of buildings, mature trees, and regular building height. Much of the townscape remains close to its original form, although public/private boundaries, windows, and some elements of the public realm have been renewed. Houses are generally plain in style and have many common elements, leading to a coherent townscape. Buildings often demonstrate elements of the 1930‰Û¡ÌÝå»s ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáneo-vernacular‰Û¡ÌÝå» style.Post-war pre-fabricated bungalows along Grainsby Close are arranged in a stepped pattern running broadly parallel to the road. All but one of the bungalows have been faced in brick and rendered during the Modern Period.

Dr Vince has outlined the suggested sequence of structures which advanced the shoreline westwards and converted it from a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhard‰Û¡ÌÝå» into a quayside during the 10th century (chapter 9a). This process needs to be better documented however, and, in particular its date needs to be firmly established. Furthermore, investigation so far has been confined either to the sequence of quaysides or to properties on the High Street frontage. We are without any understanding of the buildings which must have existed facing the water across the quayside itself. Such buildings will be of great importance in characterising the trade undertaken from the Wigford shoreline and the dates at which it was active. Presumably this area of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s waterfront was most active when the Fossdyke was in full operation, i.e. in the period between the 10th and the 14th centuries. It would be helpful to understand whether development here was entirely dependent on the Fossdyke, as it seems to have been in the Industrial Era, or whether, alternatively, boats were trading from these Wigford quays along the Witham towards Boston.",Summary,"The limits of the reclaimed land in the north-western part of Wigford are relatively clearly understood and so the RAZ follows the modern edge of the Witham along the west and north and a line through the properties parallel with the street and about 150m to the west.

The market place is a long narrow rectangle, placed east to west and with roads entering at three of the four corners. In this respect it resembles many market places in surrounding villages and towns, but it is the only regular space of this type within the city. Its relative date is critical and could be established through archaeological investigation within the (presumably newly laid-out) properties along its sides. Alternatively, work along the original lines of Midhergate or Carholme Road north and south of the market may indicate when these streets were diverted. The market could, however, belong to the same group of early modern foundations of suburban markets made to try and stimulate the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economy in the Early Modern Era. The market was dominated by the Buttercross, which was apparently placed towards its east end and formed some type of shelter (as it was subsequently moved to the churchyard of St Peter-at-Arches to protect the relocated market there from the elements Hill 1956, 202). This type of market cross may date from the 14th or 15th century and consequently it may be evidence that the market was another of those re-established in the Early Modern Era to stimulate the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s flagging economy (RAZ 10.19). Certainly the pottery from pits excavated at CRS98 suggest that the area which was subsequently within the market place was within the back yards of properties facing on to Midhergate in the late 13th century. The establishment of the market, therefore, is later in date than this.As the market seems to be a late superimposition into the townscape, deposits which predate it will be usefully sealed beneath a horizon, whatever date that horizon may be. This may be especially valuable along the south of the market place, where earlier medieval buildings which fronted on to the north side of the original line of Carholme Lane should be better preserved (in the back yards of the buildings which front on to the market space) than many buildings of these dates in the city - cf. also RAZ 9.31. These properties along the north side of the former line of Carholme Road could be distinctive anyway; it is possible that, rather than lining a conventional street, they lined the north side of a road that opened directly on to the river frontage facing Brayford. There is no documentation suggesting any quayside activity here, but the possibility that the north side of the Brayford was used as a landing place during the 11th and 12th centuries should not be ruled out.",Summary,"The RAZ for the market includes the broad street itself, with the intention of managing deposits and structures related to the market itself. This means that the modern street front on the south side is included within this RAZ. The properties along the western boundary of modern Newland (south of the junction with Newland Street West) also look like modern infill development, encroaching on to the market space itself, and so are included within this RAZ. Surfaces and other structural features relating to the market (and providing evidence for temporary stalls etc.) might be preserved underneath and behind the houses along the south and west sides.

This civic aspect of the church means that its layout and fittings can also be read as the index of official City Council opinion on the doctrinal debates of the 19th century. Any evidence for the alteration or re-decoration of the church in these years will be of considerable interest. It was probably the recollection of this importance to city which meant that, when it was demolished in 1933, the stone architectural details from the church were transplanted into a brick copy of the building built at the centre of the new St Giles estate (RAZ 11.92.4) (Anon c.1933). Burials from this graveyard (probably made down to the 1850s) will be particularly helpful in assessing to what extent the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era. In this case, because of the rather odd status of the parish (with few actual parishioners but with considerable investment from the City Council) we might expect burials here of exclusively high status.

The church itself does not occur until 1302, but documents related to properties said to be within the parish occur from the later 12th century (ed. Major 1968, 199-200, 210-11, Nos. 2607, 2619). It may have ceased to function as a parish by the late 14th century, but the cemetery remained defined until at least 1457 (Jones et al. 1996, 127). According to the models developed by Prof. Crawford to explain the distribution of St Clement dedications, it is possible that the church was founded at the start of the 11th century during the reign of Cnut (2000, pers. com.). According to this model, some St Clement dedications in England were given to churches within the defensive enclosures of the king and his upper aristocracy. We have already seen that the upper Roman city was just such an enclosure in the years following the Norman Conquest, and a case has been made that it also had this character in the late pre-Conquest period (Stocker forthcoming a). St Clement-in-the-Bail, therefore, seems to fit this model very well and, although it could be objected that the church was located in a peripheral position within the enclosure, we have seen that churches such as St Paul, which are more centrally placed, were also founded well before the start of the 11th century. Indeed this church was always in a relatively unoccupied part of the city, and this may suggest that there were special factors (such as the establishment of a royal chapel) leading to its foundation. St Clement‰Û¡ÌÝå»s peripheral location meant that it was clearly never a well-populated parish, and this suggests that, whatever the circumstances of its foundation, its structural development, or lack of it, will be instructive. It may also mean that its graveyard, being occupied, presumably, by more peripheral members of society, will provide a particularly interesting sample. The value of the graveyard population will also be enhanced by the early date at which the churchyard went out of use, narrowing the likely time-span during which interment took place. Because the graveyard is of particular interest efforts should be made at this site (over and above efforts made elsewhere) to recover the sample complete, rather than piecemeal.",Summary,"Although the churchyard was identified for many years with that of St Mary Magdalene on the east side of West Bight, it is now thought probable that it occupied a plot on the other side of the road, in the vicinity of the water tower (Jones et al. 1996, 127).

152a1dfa-a2a8-41d8-86a0-529499d49682,LARA RAZ AREA,,Quayside east of High Bridge,"The water-logged deposits along the river frontages are amongst the most valuable components of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s archaeological resource and, where they survive, they offer the prospect of understanding of many aspects of Roman life (such as diet, economy and life-style) which are not often found in deposits elsewhere in the city. Consequently, most of the issues raised in this Assessment will be illuminated to some extent by investigation of these deposits. In addition to these more fugitive issues illustrating life in Lindum as a whole, there are several key structural matters that need to be addressed in investigations in this RAZ. Specifically, the sequence of waterfront development put forward by Mr Jones, based on existing knowledge, leaves several key points unexplained (chapter 7a). He makes the case that the port facilities east of High Bridge started when the 2nd-century wall was constructed within the existing water of the river. Whether there had previously been hards to the north of the line of the city wall is hard to say, but they were not detected in the critical north-south section drawn by Drury in his 1888 study. It seems from this section, and from the results of excavations at Waterside North (WNW88, WF89, WO89, WN89), that there was little or no exploitation of the area in front of the newly built city wall until well into the 4th century. This suggests that for over a century the water lapped right up against the walls, which were reflected in it. The city wall may have looked, therefore, at least as much ornamental as defensive. It was not until the 4th century that we see dumping in front of the wall aimed at the creation of hards which could be used for the landing of boats. At this time, also, postern gates into the city were cut through the wall and it is clear that some small-scale commercial activity would have become possible here. These conclusions are unexpected. It has always been presumed that Lincoln in the 2nd and 3rd centuries was an important centre for waterborne trade, but if these conclusions about the Roman waterfront are correct we may have to modify this view. One possibility is that the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s commercial quaysides were located to the south-east, in the same Stamp End area where they were located during the medieval period (eg, RAZ 9.2). There has been no excavated evidence to help with this point and further information on the use of the quayside in the eastern part of RAZ 7.8 should be sought urgently. The alternative explanation of these results is that we are using an inappropriate model for the city in the 2nd and 3rd century. It may be that no quayside was provided when the wall was built, because such a feature was simply not needed. Such explanations, laying stress on non-commercial aspects of Lindum‰Û¡ÌÝå»s importance, might provide more support for the idea that Lincoln at this period was more of a ritual site than a trading centre. In such a view the wall itself might be seen not so much as a defence for the citizens within but as a precinct boundary. The view of the city from the south, with the walls rising out of the water, may have been particularly important - emphasising the fact that the temple complex within (RAZ 7.20) had been founded on the sacred powers of the water by which it stood (cf. RAZ 5.2, 5.8, 6.4, 6.7). In the 4th century, however, Lindum acquired a formal hard and this clearly marks a dramatic change in the character of the settlement at this time. The question to be answered at Lindum (as it is in many such ports) is whether this change was a gradual process, or did it occur all at once? Did individual property owners attempt to gain a commercial advantage one by one, by constructing personal hards? Or, by contrast, was the construction of the hard a single act, at a given moment, by an urban authority that saw the development of the quayside as an essential infrastructural development for economic advancement? This specific question brings into com",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ are drawn along the town wall to the north and the Wigford causeway to the west. To the south the boundary is drawn along the middle of the modern river to ensure that submerged deposits and structures are included. The eastern boundary requires further discussion. Clearly the quayside extends as far as the dock (RAZ 7.9), but does it extend beyond it further east? We have no information at all on this point so far, but, if we presume that the Stamp End causeway (RAZ 7.13) still survived into the Roman period (as we suspect), it is likely that the north bank of the pool, between the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádock‰Û¡ÌÝå» and Stamp End, will also have been used as a commercial quayside. This would be particularly likely if the Stamp End causeway was incorporated into a late 4th-century system to control water levels in the pool to the west. Consequently investigation along the river side east of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádock‰Û¡ÌÝå» and west of Stamp End is an urgent priority.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.8,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.8,

It has been proposed (RAZ 9.22) that the street itself may have developed out of the line of drapers' booths laid out on the hillside at some date in the 10th or 11th century. The market name seems to have disappeared sometime in the 15th century (Cameron 1985, 22) and this may indicate its closure or removal, along with the other hillside markets, during the 16th century. We badly need to know what type of properties eventually became established along the sides of the market street during the medieval period and the process of their decline, subdivision and/or reconstruction will document the eventual failure of the market itself leading to its presumed consolidation with the other city markets in the lower High Street by the 18th century (RAZ 10.22.9). Drapery was, however, one of the commodities which was certainly being traded in shops in 16th-century London and it may be that, by the 16th and 17th centuries, progressively less material was being traded from street stalls in any case.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street itself and the rows of properties along the street.

A recent study has identified at least five phases of construction in the present building (Hall et al. 1984), the earliest dating to 1160, and because the bridge is the very pivot around which the city turns, understanding this complexity will tell us a great deal about the sequence of development in the city as a whole. All works, both to the tenements on the western side and to the fabric below road level must be carefully monitored and recorded. The road surface itself also requires archaeological attention when repair or enhancement work is undertaken - not just because earlier road surfaces themselves may be of interest but because it is likely that information about the bridge chapel of St Thomas (first mentioned in 1200 - Hill 1948, 149; Cameron 1985, 135-6) will be preserved below the pavement on the eastern side.The second phase of the bridge structure, that said to date from 1235 in the study by Hall et al., but probably somewhat earlier, demonstrates that the bridge was built alongside a paved ford. This ford is also of very great importance as it is potentially more ancient than the bridge and we need to understand periods during which it was maintained or enhanced.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include not just the presently visible bridge structure but approximately 20m to north and 100m south in order to incorporate the full extent of the surviving buried abutments.

16d1ddb6-fdaf-41b5-a9fd-75d3dc8ff04e,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Sincil Dyke West Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe townscape of Sincil Dyke West (Figure 1) consists largely of regular grid-like residential streets dating from the Post-Railway Expansion and Late Victorian/Edwardian Periods, interspersed with areas of comprehensive redevelopment dating from the late 20th century. However, earlier features, in particular medieval burgage plots, the course of the former Roman road, and the historic watercourses bordering the south and east of the Character Area, strongly influenced the development of the existing townscape.The area of Sincil Dyke West is defined by the strong linear boundaries of Sincil Dyke to the south and east, and the rear of properties along High Street to the west. Properties along its borders tend to look into the Character Area rather than outwards towards adjacent Character Areas. There is good accessibility to the east and west, but poor vehicular permeability in a north/south direction, except along the adjacent High Street. There is comparably better pedestrian movement across Sincil Dyke and north/south along established footpaths.Properties in the Character Area are almost entirely composed of residential housing, the majority of which is in the form of continuous Victorian terraced rows with smaller interspersed areas of comprehensive redevelopment dating from the Modern Period. Modern housing ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáestates‰Û¡ÌÝå» vary in style, scale and construction, but within each estate buildings have a coherent form.The Character Area contains key townscape elements generally common to both Modern and Late Victorian/Edwardian properties. Building density is high, and properties are two storeys in height, with the exception of some modern apartment blocks, which are three storeys in height. Continuous building lines, consistent building height and the proximity of buildings to the carriageway result in a good and regular sense of enclosure. Frontages have high solid-to-void ratios with many doors and windows facing the street, giving an overall feeling of activity. Small-scale materials are used throughout the Character Area. Roofs are of shallow pitch and are mainly gabled, with their rooflines aligned parallel to the street.Late Victorian/Edwardian properties are coherent in scale, form and construction. Properties are mainly of two bay width, built of Albion brick in Flemish bond, set at the back of the footway or with small forecourts and canted/rectangular bay windows. The individuality of buildings is emphasised in the architectural detail and decorative materials used in features such as the eaves, verges, sills, lintels, door and window arches, and bay windows. Decoration distinguishes individual or groups of buildings from other terraces along the same streets or elsewhere in the Character Area. Few Late Victorian/Edwardian properties retain original features, as the majority of doors, windows and rainwater goods have been replaced using modern plastic materials. Modern buildings consist of detached blocks and/or semi-detached houses constructed of brick laid in stretcher bond, set in the middle of their plots. Modern buildings are plain in appearance, and often turn their backs or sides to the road. Many properties have gardens or hard standing to the front and rear.Roads in the Character Area, mainly of two cars‰Û¡ÌÝå» width, are surfaced with tarmac and have concrete kerbs, although a few Late Victorian/Edwardian footway materials survive. Road nameplates, including many surviving Late Victorian/Edwardian examples, are mounted at first floor level on houses. Street furniture is mainly modern, although again some elements of the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period survive including cast iron sunken gutters and boot scrapers. Throughout the Character Area cars are frequently parked at the side of the road, both partially on and off the footway. Small areas of garaging reflect the increased use of the private motorcar.There is a distinct lack of public or private open space within the Character Area. Tree and vegetation cover is limited and is generally restricted to small lawns, areas of planting around modern apartment blocks, and areas of scrub along Sincil Dyke and Great Gowt.The Character Area contains no landmark buildings or individual historic buildings; however, the coherent Late Victorian/Edwardian townscape as a whole is of historical note.Long views mainly comprise ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoutlet views‰Û¡ÌÝå» along roads towards High Street, and along Sincil Dyke towards the Cathedral. Within the Character Area there are good views along terraced streets.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 11,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,73,

17542575-6221-445c-a4c7-8ab47a6151dd,LARA RAZ AREA,,Local roads,"East and west of the lower city, the roads leading into Clasketgate gate and Newland Street West from the water-meadows to east and west of the city are thought unlikely to have been used by any traffic except local traffic with the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s suburbs in these locations and with the fields beyond. This does not mean that the roads in these directions are not of interest. Monks Road, (leading due east from Clasketgate gate), led directly to the Monks Leas estate and the history of its repair, use and abandonment will chart the litigious relationship which the city authorities had with the Monks of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s York. It will also be of important in understanding the character of, and variations in, the commercial traffic on the Witham, as it will have been one of the routes by which boats unloaded at ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáBlackdyke‰Û¡ÌÝå» and its related installations (RAZ 9.2) qv)) will have entered the city centre. Parallel with Monks Road and running along the cliff top there was also a local road on the line of Lindum Terrace and Sewell Road. Dr Vince (chapter 9a) has suggested that this road was called Wintergate (Cameron 1985, 111) and was also medieval in origin and would not only have given access to the city fields, but also to some of the more prominent wells and mills along the cliff edge, such as the Cold Bath. Once through the suburb, the road westwards from Newland (on the line of Newland Street West) led to the richest of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s agricultural land. Air photographic information suggests that it may have been aligned with a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágreen end‰Û¡ÌÝå» in the open field system and this relationship between the road and the field which it served needs to be investigated. Information about the development of these routes may help in understanding the dates at which the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s fields were laid out and may even hint at the changing agricultural regime practised there.",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries for all of these roads have been drawn to include a 10m margin along either side of the modern roads. Where the medieval road line is thought to depart from the modern, the RAZ is broadened to 50m to ensure that any alternative phases of alignment are detected.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.12.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.12.3,

176346c9-e394-4a7b-b3a1-30289f59dc17,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Paul-in-the-Bail,"Many commentators have expressed opinions on the interpretation of the St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s sequence, which is without doubt one of the most interesting in early medieval urban archaeology in England. Broadly speaking two schools of interpretation have developed, although each commentator has brought their individual refinements The first proposals to be advanced, whilst the site was still being dug, was that most recently championed by Sawyer (1998, 226-30), in which the Forum remained an empty open space in the late Roman period and was a deserted field of ruins through the 5th and 6th centuries. Towards the end of this period a rectilinear structure of unknown function was constructed. It is sometimes said that this first building might have been a church, and a sequence of churches developed on the site once it had been demolished. In the early 7th century, according to this interpretation, a building which certainly was a church was then built. It had a classic ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáAugustinian‰Û¡ÌÝå» missionary plan (i.e. an un-aisled rectangle with an eastern apse) used at the well-documented churches in south-east England and was built in the centre of the former forum space. This structure was built in a timber-planked technique and, at the centre of the cord of its apse (i.e. at the place of highest honour before the altar) a focal burial was made, accompanied by the 7th-century hanging bowl. The church attracted a burial ground which developed through the 8th and 9th centuries until, in the 10th century, the original church was replaced by a small rectangular stone structure, once again focused on the grave originally buried before the high altar. This may have been the occasion for the transfer of the burial in this grave elsewhere; an act which can be interpreted as the translation of the bones of a local saint from the grave into a shrine or an altar in a newly built church - potentially one of the other known churches in the bail, perhaps St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. There is no categorical evidence from the excavation which can disprove this sequence and it remains a possible interpretation. The sequence does require some flexibility in one‰Û¡ÌÝå»s view of the radiocarbon dates from the critical burials which cut into the robber trenches left by the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáAugustinian‰Û¡ÌÝå» plan church; they all need to be allocated dates at one end of their ranges, but Peter Sawyer showed how such an interpretation was possible. This interpretation is neatly consistent with it the documentary evidence, and, perhaps for this reason, it is generally preferred by those coming at the topic from a historical background. Unless one is to postulate two such sites in Lincoln in the early or mid 7th century, this interpretation must suggest that St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is the church mentioned by Bede in his account of Paulinus‰Û¡ÌÝå» conversion of Blaecca. This connection of St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s with St Paulinus‰Û¡ÌÝå» baptism of Blaecca is of great antiquity dating back to at least 1180 (Hill 1948, 103-5). The alternative view of the St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s sequence has been advocated by Mr Jones (chapter 7a), and this proposes that, from the late 4th century, a succession of ritual buildings were constructed in the centre of the Forum courtyard, a still vital and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásacred‰Û¡ÌÝå» public space. Once again, the character of the first structure remains unclear although, according to this theory also, it need not be a church. Quite rapidly, probably before the end of the 4th century, the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáAugustinian‰Û¡ÌÝå» plan building was constructed, forming a centrally placed extension eastwards from the western colonnade around the Forum. This, it is argued, might have been the Episcopal church of Roman Lindum, replacing the temple of the imperial cult, which was located elsewhere in the Forum complex. This late Roman church was then deliberately demolished around the end of the Roman period and the site was occupied through the 5th and 6th centuries by a small-scale, intermittently used, cemetery of Christian character - attracted, it is suggested, by the former site of",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the footprint of the former Forum buildings. We have seen that the ruins of the Forum courtyard might have formed a well-defined and enclosed space within which burial might have been somewhat easier than in the rubble of the Forum ranges themselves. The possibility that the basilica was converted for use as a church at some stage has been frequently suggested, and this would certainly provide a plausible explanation for the survival of the Mint Wall. For this reason the basilica has to be included within the RAZ and, furthermore, the well in the east range seems to have continued in use (or at least there is no evidence that it was blocked between the 5th century and the 10th)-. As two ranges may have been associated with the burial site in the Early Medieval Era, we might expect similar reuses of the west and south ranges, and so they are also included within the RAZ. As no unexplained burials have been discovered in the upper city outside the Forum, it may be that the burial activity was confined within the forum space, rather than within the larger space defined by the Roman walls.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,8.1.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,8.1.1,

Consequently, the modern city includes small parts of the open field systems of the parishes of Nettleham and Greetwell (RAZ 9.9.2). The boundary between the field system of Lincoln and that belonging to Nettleham was marked by a feature in the landscape, probably a ditch and bank perhaps enhanced by a hedge, which was known as Nettleham Mere (Cameron 1985, 185). There is no documentary evidence for a similar feature dividing the city from the open fields of Greetwell and Burton, but it is highly likely that there was such a feature. Where the roads to Burton and Wragby cross this feature we might expect a marker of some type (like those documented on Greetwell Road, Nettleham Road, and Ermine Street - RAZ 9.45.3, 9.45.4, 9.45.5) and these should be searched for in future research. There is great interest in the original date of establishment of the boundary feature, or its component parts (if it was laid out at different dates) as this will presumably indicate the date of the layout of the Lincoln field systems.",Summary,"To the north-east and east the RAZ is conceived as a band 100m wide following the known line of the former city boundary.

17b24c81-3d73-4cfb-839a-036d2b2a1803,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,St. Peter at Gowts Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSt. Peter at Gowt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Character Area (is a low-lying flat area of land at the base of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáWitham Gap‰Û¡ÌÝå». The Character Area is strongly influenced by High Street, which follows the alignment of a former Roman military road, Ermine Street. The character and function of buildings vary considerably throughout the Character Area, illustrating the successive re-development of the townscape and the evolution of High Street as the dominant commercial and transport route in the south of Lincoln, particularly during the High Medieval and Late Victorian/Edwardian periods.The Character Area is strongly influenced by its medieval development, seen in surviving buildings along its length, such as St. Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall, Whitefriars and St. Peter at Gowt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Church. In addition, the boundaries of medieval burgage plots are retained in the orientation of many of the east/west roads and building plots running off High Street.Urban blocks in the Character Area are generally small, as a result of regular road infrastructure running perpendicularly off High Street. Streets branching off High Street mainly date from the Post-Railway Expansion or Late Victorian/Edwardian Periods, although smaller lanes, exclusively on the west side of High Street, date to the Early Industrial Period. These lanes frequently retain components of their original street construction, whereas High Street and other roads are tarmac with modern concrete paving. Building density in the Character Area is high throughout. The form, materials and architectural style of buildings vary considerably along High Street, reflecting the plot by plot development and re-development of the road since the medieval era. The height of buildings varies between two to three storeys, resulting in a discontinuous pattern of rooflines. A wide variety of building materials are used throughout the Character Area, and properties frequently show signs of modification through extensive re-use. Shop fronts are a distinctive feature of the Character Area, and their diversity illustrates over 150 years of commercial activity along High Street. There is a high occupancy of retail units throughout, and an overall sense of vitality due to the high proportion of active frontages. Frontages are mainly narrow, especially on older premises, mostly of two-bay width, a large number of which have splayed doorways to the side. Large shop fronts have three bays or more, and frequently have doors positioned centrally. Shop fronts are mainly constructed of wood, with large windows, low stall risers and shallow cornices and pilasters. At street level, the solid-to-void ratio is low, except around more modern retail units within St. Marks. The north of the Character Area, around St. Marks, is dominated by larger commercial premises mainly occupied by national retail chains, in contrast to the south, which has a higher number of smaller independently run shops.Despite the wealth of diversity, the Character Area has strong consistencies, which together form an underlying but distinctive set of coherent townscape elements. Although there is some variation in height, buildings are almost entirely two to three storeys and are set at the back of the footway, resulting in a good sense of enclosure throughout. Above ground floor level, buildings have a high solid-to-void ratio with mainly vertical sash windows, which are comparatively smaller on the second floor than the first. Several Victorian/Edwardian properties have projecting first-floor bay windows, especially along Portland Street. Edge buildings are generally plain in construction, with solid walls built of small-scale materials, with a predominance of brick, although windowsills and lintels are frequently accentuated in stone or concrete. Roofs on edge buildings are mostly gabled, with their ridgelines running parallel to the street. Corner buildings tend to be of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhigher status‰Û¡ÌÝå» and emphasise the junction with High Street. They frequently address the corner, e.g. both modern and Victorian buildings on the Tentercroft Street/St Marks Street junction. The status and function of civic and religious buildings are reflected in their divergence from the norm, being set back from the pavement with gables facing High Street. Buildings of this sort tend to be comparatively more decorative. Many of the Character Area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s landmark and historic buildings occupy corner plots.Areas of more coherent townscape character around Portland Street and St. Marks represent more comprehensive phases of development during the Late Victorian/Edwardian and Modern periods.Space to the rear of buildings in the Character Area mainly consists of single-storey outbuildings and small yards. Many of the buildings are unoccupied and several are derelict. Building plots in this area are frequently not clearly defined and amalgamated. Much of this rear space on the east side of the Character Area is used for open-air car parking.Open space and tree and vegetation cover in the Character Area is limited, demonstrating the historically high commercial value of land, further illustrated by the correspondingly high building density.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 71,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,69,

17bc1f4d-c30d-40b4-be4c-8b3664ffe460,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Upper Wigford (north of Great Gowt),"Surprisingly little is known from excavation of the character of housing in the suburb between the 9th and the 14th centuries. Even so some speculative possibilities have been floated and it should be the role of subsequent work here to investigate these paradigms. The first of these speculations relates to the sequence of development of commercial activity on the abandoned Roman peninsula. Development here, it is suggested (eg. Stocker 2000), followed a common model for the development of permanent settlements on islands and on the banks of rivers throughout medieval Europe. First the sloping sandy or gravel shore became a beaching place for boats of riparian traders; then over time, traders‰Û¡ÌÝå» booths were established above the high water mark. Subsequently, it is argued, such a beach market would be replanned with a proper layout of streets, churches and other facilities, and provided with an upright quayside. What little we know of the archaeology of the northern half of Wigford would fit this model comfortably, but it remains a model to be tested through excavation in the future. The 'strands' were clearly mainly on the western side of the suburb, although (with our new understanding of the layout of the port - RAZ 9.5 - we should not lose sight of the likelihood that there were potential landing places on the east side of the peninsula at least as far south as the parish of St Mary-le-Wigford. The model would indicate that the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌástrand‰Û¡ÌÝå» phase may have occupied the late 9th through to the mid 10th century and that it was only in the second half of the 10th century that any re-planning took place. At present this judgement is based only on the sudden appearance of graveyards at St Marks (SM76) and St Mary-le-Wigford in the second half of the 10th century, which are laid out along the central street (Stocker 2000), and not on the recovery of domestic buildings. The only other sign of such buildings came in the form of the building slots cut into the surface of Ermine Street at St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall (SMG82), but although post Roman and pre 12th century, the slots here were essentially undated. Recovery of any such surviving buildings along the Ermine Street frontage must be considered a major priority for future work.The second model, which relates to the development of domestic buildings in Wigford, was also proposed as the result of excavations at St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall (Stocker 1991, 3-4). It is that, from the 12th century onwards, the suburb became the favoured residence of the urban elite. Certainly we have plenty of evidence for the construction here of important town-houses in the 12th and 13th centuries and also many accounts of the residence here of key citizens. It was argued in 1991 that many of these important figures may have been attracted here by the decision of the King to build his Lincoln house (hospicium) in this part of the city, whether or not St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall represents the remains of that house (Ibid.). The remains of several of these high-status buildings are known, even if they do not survive (St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hall, Sibthorpe House, Scotch Hall) and the positions of others are known through documentary evidence. St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall does survive of course and has already been the subject of intensive archaeological study (Ibid.), but the other building which might retain fabric of this date, St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Row, has yet to be studied. Exley and Williamson (1955-6) and Stanley Jones (1990, 145) both suggest that the building reported on this site by Willson had features which would date it to the 12th or 13th century but both presume that all traces of this earlier structure were removed when the range was rebuilt by Mr Peart in 1797. It is possible, however, that much evidence for the original form of this early row-like building survives within the modern fabric and any information about the layout or date of the buildings will be of great importance to our understanding of this little known class of st",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries have been drawn to include the High Street frontages of Upper Wigford north of Great Gowt.

Few comparisons express the advances made in educational thinking between 1870 and the Edwardian period more eloquently than a comparison between the Upper Lindum Street building and the new purpose-built buildings at Wragby Road. In particular the provision for science rooms in the new buildings represents an important trend in educational thinking which was to prove typical of the 20th century nationally. Again these buildings exemplify their purpose in both their layout and in many of the architectural fittings with which they were fitted, and it is important that the original plan forms and the details themselves are recorded during repair and alteration. The comparison between the facilities provided here and at the City School (especially following its contemporary expansion in 1906) will be particularly interesting, as both institutions were dedicated to education in sciences (RAZ 11.56).",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the boundary of the site depicted on the 1907 O.S. map and includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.59,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.59,

183189ec-e583-431e-85c1-cf2a00bbd61a,LARA RAZ AREA,,Holy Cross Wigford,"We have seen that the foundation of this church is a matter of interest (RAZ 9.60.16), but we know little of its late medieval history. The foundation of the Guild of St Sepulchre here (perhaps in 1376 - Westlake 1919, 166-75) indicates some level of institutional vitality and the Guild is likely to have had some impact on the liturgical layout of the church and so is its redundancy. We know little of its history in the late medieval period but in 1548 its bells were taken down (presumably to be sold - HMC 1895, 41) and in 1551 the building was leased out by the City Council to the recently reformed guild of Clothiers ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáfor the making of a walk mill and a dye house of the church‰Û¡ÌÝå» (HMC 1895, 44; Stocker 1990). This venture represents one of several late medieval and early modern attempts by the City Council to stimulate the cloth manufacturing industry in the city (see e.g. 10.53.4) and in this case will be of particular interest because the terms of the lease are so specific. The process of conversion will be very revealing about popular attitudes to the Reformation. Was any care taken in converting the building for such profane uses (for example reburial of disturbed bodies, avoidance of certain parts of the church for certain functions) or was it treated simply as a new building? Is there any evidence that the church was formally deconsecrated before being turned over to its new uses? The converted church is itself of very great interest. It is not often that we have the opportunity to study a newly designed factory of a known date as we seem to have here and full advantage should be taken. Future archaeological research should aim to reveal the whole process of manufacture in an integrated manner and this may mean insisting on total excavation. Residues from the dye-stuffs will be an important aspect of the site and care should be taken to ensure that deposits are appropriately sampled to address questions over the origins of the dyes (woad, madder, oil and alum are mentioned in the city minutes). Although not mentioned in the lease, it is likely that the churchyard was also used for purposes connected with the production of the cloth, perhaps as a tenterground, and it should also be carefully searched for information on this process. Hill reports that cloths were dried on the close west of the churchyard, presumably leading down to the river and so this area is also included in the RAZ (1956, 67). We should also be aware that the manner in which the line of Little Gowts Drain departs from the Witham and empties back on to Great Gowt looks rather like the head and tail race for a watermill. Little Gowt is first mentioned in 1383 (Cameron 1985, 124) so if it owes its origin to a mill, it was much earlier in date than the cloth works at Holy Cross, but the latter could have re-used an earlier mill leat. The fact that the scheme had failed by 1558 (Hill 1956, 68) makes the site even more valuable as the processes established in 1551 will not have been greatly altered during their working life.",Summary,"The location of the churchyard is known (RAZ 9. 60.16), and was bounded by the Gowts Drain on the north and High Street on the east. Its south and west boundaries are not known, but it is possible that the southern boundary lay along the north bank of the Little Gowt, making the church effectively the only building along the street front on the island formed between the two drains. The strip of land west of the churchyard (presumably between it and the river) was also granted by the City Council to the Clothiers in 1551 for use as a drying ground for the cloths and so is included in the RAZ.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.16,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.16,

19631d15-ddfc-4d51-a16e-80b1b95b086a,LARA RAZ AREA,,Potential industrial area around South Common,"The surface geology and topography of the modern South Common are very similar to West Common (RAZ 7.4.1) and therefore, we might expect this RAZ to have been exploited in exactly similar ways in the Roman (and in later) periods. The quarries on South Common, along with those on West Common, might be looked to, for example, as potential locations of the Corieltauvian school of mosaicists (Smith 1984). This group were once thought to have been based at Water Newton, but Millett (1990, 175-6) amongst others, has pointed out that the late Roman schools of mosaicists are usually based in cantonal capitals, which, for the Corieltauvi would suggest either Leicester or Lincoln. Many of the materials used by the mosaicists would have been imported to the region anyway, but some of the basic stone-working skills required might have been found adjacent to known quarries- like those at South and West Common. The undated earthworks of quarrying of both the exposures of Lincolnshire limestone, and the clay exposures that lie beneath, are very clearly visible today. These clays may have supplied nearby pottery kilns, and the 3rd-century kiln at Cross O‰Û¡ÌÝå» Cliff Court, discovered in 1991, but outside the modern city boundary, (Donel 1992b) probably used clay from the upper exposures along the cliff face. Although the earthworks of early quarrying are undated, it is not impossible that the earliest date from the colonia period and a survey of the earthworks should be a priority, as a preliminary step in the production of a management plan which reconciles the potential environmental and heritage importance of this area with its use for leisure and recreation.",Summary,"The southern boundary of this RAZ follows the city boundary along the top of the hill slope. Any industrial zone is likely to have respected the pre-existing road line (RAZ 7.1) and to have continued on the south-west forming, with the line of the modern city boundary, a triangular area between Ermine Street and the Fosse Way. The ground between the Fosse Way and the river line may have been utilised for similar industrial purposes, although no evidence for this has yet been forthcoming. The northern boundary of the RAZ will be formed by the southern limit of the settlement (at the north-east corner) and by the limits of the dry land to the north-west. Although there is no evidence for the uses to which the long, low-lying strip of land north of Washingborough Road was put in the Colonia Era, it is topographically continuous with the suspected zone of industrial activity north of South Common and it is similar in character to the Racecourse area, and it may, therefore have also had some industrial use, perhaps combined with grazing.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.5,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.5,

Here the stone was probably not worked from a quarry face (as it was in RAZ 10.41.1 and 10.41.2) but in pits. These pits are frequently mentioned in the documentary sources, and the part of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s open field north of church lane was known as Stonefield by the 19th century. There is no indication of the ownership of these stone-pits and, as they were also in the common fields, these diggings may also have been worked by citizens as part of their common rights. Although the techniques of working the stone in these (presumably relatively shallow) pits will have been different from those used on the south and west commons, it may, nevertheless, be possible to use archaeological techniques, and comparison with the organisation of working in RAZ 10. 41.2, to assess whether working in these stone-pits was undertaken on a small scale by individual citizens, or by a more commercial operation. A research agenda for quarrying of this type has recently been issued (LUAU 1996a). Some of the stone from such pits might have fed limekilns, but no evidence for limekilns in this area has yet been forthcoming. Indeed, as yet, there is no evidence that the stone was processed in any way in or near the pits. Even so, such processing might be expected and the remains of lime-burning installations should be searched for. It is perhaps less likely that such pits would have produced worthwhile quantities of ironstone and so smelting is perhaps less likely in these areas, whilst it is unlikely that clay was dug in this manner.",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ cannot be described precisely, but the land affected by the excavation of stone from such pits was probably the same as in RAZ 9.41.3.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.41.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.41.3,

1a2139ca-9427-409c-8ef6-3869a1e3ec47,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Sincil Bank South Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSincil Bank South is a mixed use Character Area with mainly civic and recreational uses, plus some commercial and residential buildings mostly located in the north east of the Character Area. The Character Area has strong boundaries on all sides consisting of Modern [1967-2009 AD] housing along the former line of the railway to the north, South Park Avenue to the south, Canwick Road to the east and Sincil Dyke to the west. There is no clear neighbourhood centre although the football ground is both a key part of the city and a focal point for activity within the Character Area. The northern boundary of the Character Area also marks a significant change in townscape from the Victorian/Edwardian streets of terraced housing to the north. Following the arrival of the railway in 1882 development of mainly larger buildings and open spaces in this Character Area took place on what had formerly been enclosed fields, although a few terraced houses were built.The football ground arrived in 1895 and the area has continued to have strong recreational uses to this day. In the Post-War [1946-1966 AD] and Modern [1967-2009 AD] Periods civic uses (such as the schools, and fire and ambulance stations) developed in the Character Area, in part due to the good road links to the rest of the city.The large urban blocks in the south and west make vehicle movement across the Character Area impossible. Although the heavy traffic along South Park Avenue acts as a barrier to pedestrian movement, pedestrian routes throughout the rest of the Character Area are generally good. Vehicle links from the north and south are also good. Buildings in the Character Area are mainly situated on large plots of different shapes and there is a difference in form and scale between the mainly large single-storey buildings and the much smaller houses.

1a62c4fb-206a-4806-b630-5d3fd44b0db9,LARA RAZ AREA,,Clay quarries in the cliff face north-west and south of the city,"Although the cliff edge north-west of the city had been exploited for both clay and stone since the Roman period (RAZ 7.14, 9.41.1, 10.41.1), with the creation of West Common in 1803, somewhat further to the south, any residual common rights to dig the stone and clay will have been terminated. Even so, it seems to have taken some time before large-scale private extraction became organised, under the aegis of at least two private companies, who presumably purchased the land in the normal way. These extraction sites are all considered in conjunction with the brick and tile works which were constructed within the clay pits (RAZ 11.42).",Summary,"This RAZ has been defined in order to ensure that the research potential for the large area where small-scale 19th-century clay digging and brick manufacture took place is not missed in the study of the large known sites within it. Consequently it has been defined by the natural resource itself, extending from the top of the cliff to a point beyond its base that will allow for the recovery of the working sites. This line is estimated to be parallel to the base of the cliff and c.500m south-west of it. On the north-west it is bounded by the District boundary and on the south-east by the city wall, east of which there is unlikely to have been much clay-digging in the Industrial Era.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.41.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.41.1,
1a85fe81-3dd1-4340-b725-072802155869,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Newland suburb,"An early casualty of changing economic relationships within the city and between the city and its hinterland may have been the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s manor of Willingthorpe (RAZ 9.32.1) which is not heard of again after the mid 12th century (Cameron 1985, 46). The reasons for the disappearance of this manor are of great interest, especially if they result in the conversion of manorial rights in the vill into some kind of burgage tenure, but it is likely that any such developments will have occurred in the High Medieval rather than the Early Modern Era. Any works in the vicinity of the presumed site of the manorial curia (RAZ 9.32.1) should be accompanied by archaeological programmes designed to elucidate these matters. But it should be remembered that the manor was a legal entity not a physical one, and therefore any changes in layout of tenements anywhere in Newland, which might represent a change in the legal status of the building, will be of very great interest. If such a conversion of property holding took place, then it is likely that Willingthorpe would simply have shrunk and disappeared along with the remainder of the suburb in the 14th century. Perhaps it was because Newland‰Û¡ÌÝå»s activity seems to have been more closely related to the internal life of the city that it suffered disproportionately badly from the economic downturn. As discussed in RAZ 10.19, it is possible that the Newland market place was a new creation of the 15th century aimed at reversing this decline, but if it was a strategy of this type, it had clearly failed by 1572 when the Buttermarket was relocated to St Peter-at-Arches (RAZ 10.22.8). Although St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish had fewer than 10 inhabitants in 1428, St Stephen had more, so there was still a focus of population here, perhaps focused around the new market place (which was wholly in St Stephen‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish), although perhaps concentrated around the so called ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáCause Manor‰Û¡ÌÝå» farm (just to the north RAZ 10.32). However, Speed's map of 1611 shows few structures around Newland gate with no properties around the square, and one of the structures presumably represents Cause Farm. Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1722 map, however, seems to provide evidence for some recovery of population, as lines of properties flank the former market place once again. As in the other suburbs this process of abandonment and re-colonisation is of considerable interest. First we may gather some idea of the scale of the initial collapse after the 14th century, which may have stimulated the foundation of the market place. In the archaeology we may also be able to see what effect that measure had - were new buildings constructed or old ones modified for example? We should also be able to read the story of the failure of the market place idea and gather some idea whether the suburb was vacated by diktat when it was moved in 1572, or whether the order for removal simply confirmed a position in which traders had already deserted the site. The use to which the abandoned market was then put will also be of interest. Was the land divided up into closes and let to wealthy citizens or external gentry? Or did it continue to be used for communal purposes? And finally we need to consider the impetus (apparently following the Civil War) which encouraged the resettlement of the suburb. We know nothing of the new houses here. Were they buildings of quality attracting the new middle classes, like contemporary new building on the fringes of the London conurbation, or were they, instead, more temporary buildings accommodating the more marginal classes?",Summary,The RAZ occupies the same area as RAZ 9.31 and includes the area of 9.32.1 and 9.32.2.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.31,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.31,

The church was still active in the late Middle Ages and the fabric was left money by John Boston in 1431 (ed. Gibbon 1888, 157), but it did not survive the Reformation and was demolished between 1548 and 1560 (Stocker 1990, 21). It has been suggested that the church might have been the origin of the masonry and burials incorporated into the new porch at St Mark's church (100m north) following demolition (Gilmour and Stocker 1986, 88-9). The remarkable way in which the burials might have been transferred from the redundant church to its successor has been discussed (Ibid.) and it is imperative that we investigate St Edward‰Û¡ÌÝå»s carefully to see how it was demolished.

1b85435e-621c-456d-8511-6a177b4364e4,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Greetwell Quarry Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Greetwell Quarry Character Area is a large area of land that has been used for mining and quarrying until as recently as 2003. This industrial scale activity has had a massive impact on the character of the area and the physical landscape. However, since the end of quarrying the area has began to take on a new character and a new function, one that it is being influenced by the natural regeneration of the landscape and the range of new developments that are taking place along its northern and north-eastern boundaries. Greetwell Hollow, where mining ceased over a hundred years ago, is much further along this process than Greetwell Quarry. The Quarry, although currently wasteland, is increasingly being used for informal recreation and being gradually integrated into neighbouring residential areas both for the views that it offers and the recreational opportunities it provides.This Character Area is situated on the north-eastern boundary of the City and is bordered to the west and partly to the south by an industrial area, to the north by retail and residential development that has taken place over the last ten years, and to the east by agricultural land. The current landscape is almost entirely a result of open cast quarrying during the 20th century; however, there are some remnants of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s former rural character in addition to traces of earlier quarrying operations.The land probably formed part of the Legionary ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáterritorium‰Û¡ÌÝå» in the Roman Military [60-90 AD] and Roman Colonia Eras, an area in which agricultural production and other services were dedicated to the service of the legion. In addition to grazing and cultivation, its location may have made it suitable for early quarrying of ironstone or limestone. During the Early Medieval [410-850 AD] and Early Modern [1350-1750 AD] Eras land in the area was part of Greetwell Parish, and was probably divided into open agricultural fields for grazing and cultivation. During the Early Industrial Period [1750-1845 AD] open fields in Greetwell Parish were divided up and enclosed under a private treaty. The north-eastern boundary of the Character Area south of Blackfriars Road, and part of the western edge of the main access road in the south, follow the line of 19th-century field boundaries, some of which may incorporate earlier open field boundaries. In 1872 land within the Character Area was leased to the Mid-Lincolnshire Ironstone Company, and large-scale open-cast ironstone mining began in the south west of the Character Area and to the south of Greetwell Road. Ironstone deposits ceased to be exploited in the Inter-War Period [1920-1945 AD]; however, open cast quarrying of limestone, the remains of which dominate the Character Area, continued until August 2003.In terms of landscape, this Character Area can be divided into three separate sub-areas. The smallest of these is a fallow arable field in the south west of the Character Area. Greetwell Quarry Nature Reserve forms a large band north east of this field, extending from Carlton Boulevard in the north to Greetwell Road in the south. It has an undulating topography that supports a south-eastwards flowing stream, substantial marshy areas, calcareous grassland with scattered scrub, and dense scrub with some trees. Greetwell Quarry is a massive expanse of bare earth with limestone quarry faces along three sides that vary in height from 5 to 15 metres. The topography across the majority of the site is very flat, with sheer cliffs rising from the ground around the edges. However, there are also areas that have a more undulating topography as a result of spoil heaps, earthworks and landscaping that was undertaken during its use as a quarry.Within the Character Area there is an interesting juxtaposition of the industrial with the natural. The cliff face exposes rocks that were laid down in a warm shallow sea during the Middle Jurassic period of geological times, about 170 million years ago. However, it is man-made and only exists because of large scale industrial quarrying. The relationship between the quarry and the surrounding areas is in the process of changing. Several compacted earth footpaths line the edges of the quarry and many informal paths have been created in the basin as people have began to use the site for informal recreation such as walking, cycling and motorbiking. Access routes have been provided from the new housing developments into the quarry, thus helping to integrate it into the urban fabric. The houses have been built right up to the quarry edge, many with large windows looking out over the rock face to make use of the long views across the quarry on to Greetwell Hollow and the rural agricultural land to the east. These houses have been built since the quarry ceased operations in 2003, so the change in use of the site has influenced this change in the relationship between the quarry and these surrounding areas, giving it more of an open space and recreational value. They have also made the quarry more enclosed. In contrast, the industrial areas to the west that have been established for longer have their backs turned on the quarry and access from these areas and from Greetwell Road is very limited. The view of the Cathedral from this Character Area also gives an impression of both proximity and separation. The Cathedral is visible on the skyline and this emphasises the proximity of the area to the City centre but the foreground is formed by the back of industrial units and new housing developments. This makes it feel more isolated from the main built up area of the City. The area is also heavily influenced by the scale of the quarry and by the views out to the east of agricultural fields which give it a more rural character. In some places the eastern boundary of the quarry is so far in the distance that it is difficult to make out and this gives the impression of the open space extending indefinitely. This, and the views on to the agricultural land directly to the north east of the quarry and at the same height as the summit of the quarry faces, emphasises the fact that this Character Area is on the very edge of the City. From the quarry floor there are very different views, mostly on to the rock face and across the expanse of the quarried area. From here there is a much greater sense of enclosure.""",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 81,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,19,

1bb329bb-3e56-4d28-9e1b-284871bebb80,LARA RAZ AREA,,The College of The Vicars-Choral,"Most of the medieval buildings of the College of the Vicars Choral survived in occupation into the Industrial Era (Jones et. al 1987, 40-65); the College houses continued to be adapted and upgraded in line with the aspirations and expectations of the clergy who lived here. The minor details of their adaptation and reconstruction through this period constitute an important resource for the understanding of the development of domestic architecture and for the rising status of the Anglican clergy in society more widely. They are included within the Cathedral Conservation Plan (ed. Gibbs 2001) which spells out their importance in detail and provides a research agenda for future work. New building in the Era was confined to the house in the north-west corner of the close, where the ruins of the original college range were refashioned into a pair of houses in 1875 and c.1880 (Jones et al. 1987, 60-1).

It is possible that the fish and fowl within this area would have been seen as part of the natural resources of the territorium of the new fortress and, consequently, any changes in land-use or water management which can be dated to the Military Era will be of great importance for our understanding of the impact of the invasion (see RAZ 6.18).",Summary,"The boundary of the RAZ is formed by the city boundary south and east.

1ce33a72-99d6-45da-9617-6506220abeb7,LARA RAZ AREA,,Open Fields of Nettleham and Greetwell parishes,"The Lincoln open field layout cannot be seen in isolation, as it shared boundaries with the adjoining parishes of Burton, Riseholme, Nettleham and Greetwell, all of which appear to be nucleated settlements of the type which might represent a great re-planning of the Lindsey landscape around nucleated, parochial, settlements with open fields, which seems to be a late 9th or 10th-century phenomenon (Everson et al. 1991, 13-28; Everson and Stocker 1999, 76-9). To the east, the modern city boundary takes in small areas (relatively speaking) of the field systems of the parishes of Nettleham and Greetwell. Nettleham was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1777 (Baker 1957, 51-9) whilst Greetwell was enclosed by private treaty (Everson et al. 1991, 103-5).The archaeology of the fields in these parishes is likely to be rather coarse and uninformative on a small scale. The most informative studies will be those conducted on air photos taken before the redevelopment for housing. Some of these show evidence for ridge and furrow and, using early mapping (and the Enclosure Award for Nettleham), it may be possible to develop a picture of these field systems in their final stages. A research agenda for such systems has been articulated by D. Hall (1994). Excavation may be a less effective technique of exploration here, but even so, soil analyses from widely scattered sites in the fields may provide useful information about relative fertility and, over time, the distribution patterns of pottery may give some indication about manuring at different periods. It is likely that many boundary stones were placed in these fields, as they were in all such systems, but it is equally likely that these would have been simple rough boulders and thus not easily spotted in the modern urban environment. The fields will have contained a variety of other structures, besides soil platforms. All open field systems contained ephemeral sheds for shelter and the storage of tools, as well as earthwork and timber structures to support stands for peas and beans etc. and the locations of such features may come to light during development work within this RAZ. It will be instructive to compare all archaeological results from these two field systems with those from the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s own field system (RAZ 10.9.1). Differences in fertility and cropping practice may be detectable and might illustrate differences presumed to exist between an open field system managed by a city council and those managed by manorial courts.",Summary,The RAZ is intended to include the whole area of the field systems of both villages which falls within the modern city boundary. The remaining western boundary of the RAZ is formed by the line of the Nettleham Mere (RAZ 10.45.6).,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.9.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.9.2,

1db7de98-b3a9-4517-b589-24c49c83d0e7,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Drury Lane Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Drury Lane Character Area is situated along the edge of the north escarpment, directly south of the Castle and west of Steep Hill. The area consists mainly of large detached and semi-detached properties that have been developed, added to, and redeveloped over an extended period of time along Carline Road, Drury Lane and Spring Hill. These include two particularly large buildings, Hilton House on the corner of Union Road with its associated lodge house, and Chad Varah house on the corner of Wordsworth Street which was originally the County Infimary and is now occupied by the University of Lincoln. The main land use in the Character Area is residential, with the exception of a few properties along Spring Hill that have been converted to office accommodation, and Chad Varah House which is now used for educational purposes. The Castle's southern wall forms the rear boundary of many of the properties along the northern side of Drury Lane, making this a key feature of the area. On the southern side of Carline Road, Drury Lane and Spring Hill, the properties are situated on the slope of the escarpment. These properties have wide, uninterrupted views over the lower city and many of them have been designed to make the best possible use of this elevated position. Originally this area was at the intersection of the Roman and Medieval defensive infrastructure, including the upper and lower city walls. The route of Motherby Hill in the south of the Character Area approximately follows the line of the lower Roman city walls. After a period of decline and retraction in the Early Medieval Era [410-850 AD], the High Medieval Era was a time of comparative prosperity and central parts of the city were rebuilt. The first castle (c.1068) re-occupied the entire upper part of the upper Roman city. Several roads within the Character Area probably date to the High Medieval or Early Modern Era [1350-1750 AD], the earliest of which is Michaelgate. From the Early Modern Era [1350-1750 AD], the military function of the Castle decreased, leading to the renting and selling of surrounding land including the defensive ditches. During the Early Industrial Period, Carline Road and Drury Lane were laid out along the crest of the escarpment, and housing, mostly in the form of large semi-detached residences, developed along their lengths. The area retains a close relationship to the Castle due to its scale and proximity. In response to Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s expanding population during the Early Industrial Period, Lincoln County Hospital or Infirmary was built c.1776, and survives within the enlarged University of Lincoln building, also known as Chad Varah House after Chad Varah, the founder of the Samaritans. Expansion of housing within the Character Area continued during the Post-Railway Expansion [1846-1868 AD] and Late Victorian/Edwardian Periods, including the construction of additional detached and semi-detached residences as well as working-class houses. During the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period, Wordsworth Street, which forms part of the northern boundary of the Character Area, was constructed to join Drury Lane with Steep Hill and more central parts of the city. The Character Area changed little during the subsequent Inter-War [1920-1945 AD], Post-War [1946-1966 AD] and Modern [1968-2009 AD] Periods, with the exception of the construction of a small number of houses such as 20, 25, 25a Drury Lane and 18a Carline Road.In terms of building form, it is very difficult to describe similarities due to the great variety of properties in this area, a feature of the way that many of the plots were developed individually. The 'smaller houses' include the properties to the south of Carline Road, those to the south of Drury Lane (with the exception of Witham View House) and the terrace of houses at the eastern end of Drury Lane backing on to the Sam Scorer Gallery. Common features of these properties are that they generally face on to the road, fill the width of their plot and are positioned at the back of the footway, although several have a small forecourt or exposed basement windows. The windows are mainly wooden vertical sliding sash windows, although a number have decorative features such as margin lights, stained glass, curved/canted bays or oriel windows. Doors are generally wooden and partially glazed, with a shallow recess from the doorway. Several of the properties feature projecting windows, porches, bargeboards, stone coping and/or balconies, although they are quite plain in terms of decoration. The 'larger properties' include the detached houses along the northern side of Drury Lane, the southern side of Spring Hill and properties along Drury Lane between Union Road and Witham View House. The properties along the northern side of Drury Lane are often multi-bays wide and are set back from the road to varying degrees with a wall to the front marking the public/private boundary. They respond to the views of the Castle, which forms their rear boundary. The properties on Spring Hill generally have narrow setbacks and face both on to the road and on to the escarpment, as the rear of these properties are visible from the lower city. Among these buildings, there is a great variety of windows, many of which are canted or rectangular bays, and several have very decorative features. The buildings generally have quite shallow eaves, and a range of decorative additions such as wooden brackets, bargeboards in gables and moulded stone coping on Dutch gables. However, they are often plain beneath the eaves with only a few having shallow projecting brick courses. Hilton House is an eighteenth-century property that was remodelled around 1840. It is stuccoed, has a plinth, first-floor band, rusticated quoins and a hipped slate roof. It is two to three storeys in height and four bays wide. It has many projections on the south, east and west sides of the property including two tent-roofed canted bay windows, an angled projection with a plain sash in a round-headed opening and a square bay window with pilasters and cornice, and plain sashes. Chad Varah House is situated on the corner of Wordsworth Street and Michaelgate but is shielded from view by a woodland edge above the boundary wall to the east and by outbuildings to the north. The complex includes the main building, built as the County Infirmary in 1776-7, a chapel added in 1906, an attached house and water tower dating from the late nineteenth century and a rear addition built in 1962. The main building is south-facing and consists of a three-storey, eleven-bay faÌÎå_ade with projecting pedimented centre and flanking wings. There are many private gardens and driveways in the Character Area but the only 'public' open space is the garden around Chad Varah House, which is concealed from view by the ancillary buildings along Wordsworth Street and the high boundary wall along Michaelgate. The Character Area contains many high walls around the boundaries of properties, often with trees and shrubs growing above and this increases the sense of enclosure, particularly along Spring Hill and Michaelgate. The Character Area has a very strong relationship to both the city and surrounding areas. Its position on the edge of the escarpment means that many of the properties have taken advantage of the uninterrupted views this gives them over the lower city and the south escarpment. The close proximity of the Character Area to the Castle and Cathedral also enables many properties to take advantage of views on to these landmark buildings. In terms of movement, the area is well integrated into neighbouring Character Areas, though Drury Lane itself is generally rather quiet. Union Road and Carline Road join the area to neighbouring residential areas along Burton Road and Yarborough Road. Spring Hill links the area with the lower city, and the two footpaths, Motherby Hill and Gibraltar Hill, make movement between the uphill and downhill parts of the city particularly quick, although steep, for pedestrians.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 2,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,33,

1e07a535-d674-45a0-8f15-b03a45591a66,LARA RAZ AREA,,Railway transport network,"The coming of the railways in the 1840s was the single most important development in the Industrial Era in Lincoln. Although the expansion of water communications during the previous century did have a substantial impact on the life of the city, the coming of the railways caused a revolution (chapter 11a). Suddenly all sorts of industrial activity, which had been undertaken for several generations in the new cities of the industrial north, became possible in Lincoln itself, and the city was not slow in capitalising on the opportunity. Most of the major industrial concerns of Edwardian Lincoln had been founded in the 1840s or 1850s. The railways came to Lincoln relatively late in their development and by the time that the first train arrived in the city in 1846 many of the technological problems associated with the construction and operation of mass-market railways had been solved. Nevertheless Lincoln presented some engineering challenges to the railway builders (Ruddock & Pearson 1985). Most serious of all, probably, were the problems of unstable ground and flooding which affected the sites earmarked for the infrastructure of sidings, goods yards, warehouses etc on the Holmes Common west of Wigford. In addition many bridges were needed to cross water-courses, not to mention first one, then two, level crossings on High Street. All of these structures, which survive as both buried remains and as standing structures are of interest from both the engineering point of view and, specifically, as monuments to the development of Lincoln itself. The massive embankment of the high-level Avoiding Line (Herridge 1999, No.5403), which swept from New Boultham to Canwick Road, was a very major engineering structure (opened in 1882). Although mostly removed in the 1980s, some investigation of the surviving fragments might tell whether it was anything more than a heap of rubble in engineering terms. It might be expected that some care would be taken in an urban context, to ensure that that the embankment was stable, and evidence of this care might be present in the archaeological remains. The track-bed itself, throughout the Lincoln network, might also preserve some features of archaeological interest, such as early sleeper systems buried below later ones (Betteridge 1984, 113), but they are also substantial monuments in the landscape and have a major visual impact on the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s topography. Set along the track bed, at locations identifiable on early O.S. mapping, will be the buried remains of a multitude of items of archaeological interest such as turntables for engines, signalling systems, water and coal supply systems and many other individual features. All such features are of interest and will merit recording prior to their removal or recovery.Mr Herridge‰Û¡ÌÝå»s survey has identified a considerable number of standing structures belonging to the railway infrastructure which also require sensitive management and, usually, a measure of archaeological recording in conjunction with repair and reconstruction. First amongst these structures are the two stations. St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Station, High Street (Herridge 1999, No.5030) was built in 1846 by the Midland Railway (No.5398) and was Lincoln's first railway station. The architect is unknown, but it may have been by I. A. Davies of the Midland Railway or by W.A. Nicholson (Pevsner and Harris 1989, 525). For two years the station was a terminus, but in 1848 the junction of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (Herridge 1999, No.5399) necessitated a level crossing (No.5412) across High Street. Because it was originally laid out as a terminus, the eastern part of the track bed at the station will contain rare and important remains of the early engine turntables of 1846, which must be recorded during works in this area. The station buildings, on the north platform, were in a simple ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáclassical‰Û¡ÌÝå» style with entrance through an Ionic portico.

1f18e9fe-8dd5-4121-88eb-08dc5089b3c9,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Arboretum Avenue Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌArboretum Avenue is a largely coherent townscape from the late Victorian period with a grid-iron street pattern and two-to-three storey terraced housing. With bay windows and small forecourts, the housing is of a slightly higher social scale than the terraced housing to the south, which was nearer the industrial works. The size and location of the development was influenced by earlier field boundaries, and some medieval features such as the alignment of St. Clement‰Û¡ÌÝå»s passage can still be seen in the townscape. The housing quickly followed the development of the Arboretum immediately to the east and, together with the park and other adjacent developments of this period, forms a still wider surviving Victorian townscape.The steep slope rising up from Monks Road contributes greatly to the character by providing good views of the south escarpment across the lower city as well as creating a rising vertical rhythm of terraced building details, e.g. chimneys in the roofscape. There is a broad homogeneity of architectural form, style and material (e.g. the buildings are mainly of red Albion brick, and Welsh slate or concrete tile roofs). However, there is also a great variety of good quality detail within the broad style, e.g. various brick mouldings at the eaves. There are also slightly larger and more ornate buildings facing onto Monks Road and near the Arboretum where grander buildings were considered appropriate.The area is quiet, except along Monks Road, but has good access to the Arboretum and Monks Road itself. Access to the west and north is limited. A quiet green open space to the north also adds to the quieter character. There are many modern replacement doors, windows and rainwater goods that do not have the same details or scale as the original features.‰Û¡ÌÝÌ",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 101,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,43,

The church was the home of the Guild of St Anne founded in 1344 (Westlake 1919 166-75), which may have had some impact on the internal liturgical layout which could be detected archaeologically. Even so, this is another of the small, peripheral ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáback-street‰Û¡ÌÝå» churches whose parish held fewer than 10 inhabitants in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287) and the Vicars Choral told Bishop Alnwick‰Û¡ÌÝå»s visitation of the Dean and Chapter in 1437 that the Precentor had destroyed (prosteruit) the churches of St Peter Stanthaket and St Edmund (ed. Woolley 1913, 26). The church offers, therefore, a good example of an unaltered pre-Reformation liturgical layout. Uniquely for the pre-16th century redundancies at St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, we hear something of the redundancy process. In 1461 the City Council ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáwhite book‰Û¡ÌÝå» reported that the church has been destroyed, and that the churchyard has been used as a rubbish dump and consequently is being leased to the Precentor - presumably in the hope that he will keep the site in a more appropriate state (HMC 1895, 22). The prospect of a dated rubbish dump in the churchyard is important archaeologically, but so also is the clue that this exchange gives to the concern felt prior to the Reformation that former church sites should be treated with some dignity. Archaeological evidence to illustrate and support this degree of concern for the fabric of the church or churchyard once deconsecrated would be of great interest.",Summary,"The site of the graveyard is known. The south-eastern boundary was Michaelgate (formerly Parchmentgate) The southern and western boundaries are thought to be represented by the small triangular piece of land on the west side of Spring Hill.

1f6db6b0-d1b9-42c7-88b7-828e4e683f26,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Eastgate Suburb (and the Close within St Margaret Pottergate parish),"In the Early Modern Era the Eastgate suburb appears to be a genteel area forming, almost, an extension of the close. We know of important residents in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries and some of the capital buildings of this era have survived. Outside the Close Wall, the buildings themselves were not covered by Jones et al. and refurbishment work in them should be accompanied by building recording. In particular several of the houses along the north side of Langworthgate are of late 17th- or 18th-century date and represent prime examples of gentry houses of those dates. Most spectacular, probably, is the large town house of 1736, now the Disney Place Hotel. Furthermore, there will be buried remains of further houses of this general type. From the 16th century we know of an important house in Northgate called Deanecourte Hall, which was said to have been the home of Lord Hussey in the early 16th century and became the house of Mayor Effard (Hill 1956, 25n). From the next century we know something of the large mansion erected by Sir Cecil Wray on the north-west corner of Northgate and Eastgate. Further information about both of these important houses will be very welcome. Further down the social scale, but no less interesting, is the row of uniform houses Nos 25-7 Eastgate, which appear to date from the 17th century and may represent housing for letting. Many of these properties fronted on to the triangular green, which, we have suggested, gave the suburb its original structure (RAZ 9.17). It is not known when this green ceased to be used as a market in the Early Modern Era, but some evidence for the changing character of the suburb is likely to be found in the pattern of repair and reconstruction of the houses along the sides of the former market. Particularly critical in understanding the date at which the green was filled are the buried remains of properties between Langworthgate and Greetwellgate. Not only will they provide evidence for the date when the green ceased to be used, but they will also elucidate the character of buildings which replaced it. The green is shown clear of buildings in Speed‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1611, as indeed is the remainder of the suburb, but the block is shown already occupied by buildings by Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1722. No.2 St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane is an important early-post-medieval building, which may date from a similar period of rebuilding following the filling in of the green. Further to the east, towards St Giles‰Û¡ÌÝå» Hospital, the high-water mark of medieval settlement had probably been reached in the 11th or 12th centuries and by the early modern period this land was available for other uses. Part of it became a quarry (RAZ 10.41.2; 10.41.3 - presumably relative late in the Middle Ages) and we need to know what to uses other areas of former occupation were put. Were they put under the plough as parts of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s communal East Field, for example, or were private closes laid out for the use of particular wealthy citizens?Within the late medieval Close Wall, properties and topography along Pottergate and Boune Lane (The Greestone Stairs alignment) have been exceptionally well studied in Jones et al. 1984 and 1987. In the case of both roads, many fragments of medieval buildings survive, and detailed research agendas can be worked out building by building. Our understanding of these buildings needs to be refined and enhanced by programs of building recording carried out in conjunction with repair programs and our understanding should be set in context through future excavation work around the buildings. There is ample material here for important work on the architectural responses made by the cathedral clergy to the changes brought about by the 14th-century economic collapse. Perhaps the most remarkable thing is that, despite the dislocation caused in the commercial economy, the cathedral dignitaries were able to continue building and adorning their splendid houses, as the revenues which supported",Summary,"The various components of the RAZ are bounded to the east by the line of modern Wragby Road, which marked the extent of the suburb in the High Medieval Era.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.28,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.28,

20660a6e-5036-42ad-926e-d8044027215b,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Peter-at-Gowts,"St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s began the Industrial Era as an intact medieval building of considerable architectural importance (RAZ 9.60.28; 10.60.28) but unfortunately a north aisle was added in 1853, work which was accompanied by reconstruction of the nave (to designs by W.A. Nicholson) and then a huge new chancel was provided in 1887-8 (by Hodgson Fowler). This left little more than the tower and south aisle standing from the medieval church. The chancel, in particular, is an example of a high-church tendency within the parish, which can be further explored through study of fabric and fittings. To the north of the modern church a portion of the graveyard has been adopted by a vicarage built at about the same time as the chancel extension. It is possible that this building occupied a space once occupied by the medieval rectory. Unfortunately, the construction of the new rectory on this plot might be seen as a reflection of the attempt to get back to a closer relationship between the clergy and their churches; an idealised version of the medieval model. The rectory itself is of interest as a building, giving a clear idea, when compared with surrounding houses, of the social status of the Victorian rector.

The lock played the key role in the river improvements in the late 18th century and was completely rebuilt twice. Maintaining a high level of water here, of course, is essential if a steady high level of water is to be obtained in the Brayford Pool and consequently a reliable control of the water level became essential to the Ellisons‰Û¡ÌÝå» operation of the reconstructed Fossdyke. It is not known what influence or role the Ellisons played in the reconstruction of the Lock, either in 1770 or in 1826 (the two occasions when it was rebuilt Herridge 1999, 25, Nos. 5342 & 5343). In addition to investigating the structural remains of the earlier locks, then, we should be interested in establishing whether this work was done with public or private money - something which may be comprehensible following a comparison with other lock works, especially those on the Fossdyke. Early engravings of the lock show that, until the construction of the Clayton and Shuttleworth works on the south side of the river in the 1840s (RAZ 11.36) there was still a causeway to the south of the lock itself. The fate of this causeway during the period between c.1750 and c.1840 remains of interest, and it is clear that it played some role in the boat yard established here by Shuttleworth and Godwin in the first half of the 19th century (RAZ 11.5.1). The surviving lock was built in 1826-8 to replace the 1770 lock, which was not wide enough to take steam packets. The lock gates and sluice-gate winches were hand operated. The bottom lock paddle gates are original. The guillotine west top gate and hydraulic winches were added in 1950. The whole structure is of considerable engineering interest and should be recorded prior to alterations.",Summary,"The location of the 1826 lock is marked by the modern lock, but it is not clear that the 1770s lock was in precisely this location. The RAZ therefore includes a 100m length of the river to the east along with the river banks in which the earlier lock remains might have been located.

The decline of the late medieval parish should be visible, therefore, in the decay of the building in the late middle ages and in a decrease in numbers of burials in the churchyard. As a church closely related to the Newport market (RAZ 10.16), its decline should be a reflection of the decline of the market itself, and future work should relate the fortunes of the church to the market.

231fafc0-6c1e-4c66-99b9-fd9432346093,LARA RAZ AREA,,Food processing industries and brewing industry,"The processing of grain and other arable products was important to Lincoln well before the railways arrived. Many of the major warehouses around Brayford Pool built in the second half of the 18th century were for grain storage (RAZ 11.2.1 & 11.2.2), but processing took place as well. The grain was usually either milled into flour or into feed-cake in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s various mills, or converted into malt in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s many maltings and then used for brewing in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s breweries. Although figures are hard to collect, it is likely that, although the numbers employed in these industries were surpassed by the engineering industries in the later 19th century, this industrial sector remained Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s second largest employer.Although there were many maltings in the Industrial Era city, five have survived as standing buildings. The most thoroughly investigated is at St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall, High Street (Herridge 1999, No.5484; Stocker 1991) where the north range may have had an industrial use from the late medieval period (RAZ 10.46.2). A new north range was constructed c.1723 as a purpose-built couching floor and other parts of the complex were converted to serve as steeping tanks and kiln. The complex was upgraded c1869-91, probably by Dawber and Co. As a long-serving maltings complex changes in the management of the malting process are legible in the changes to the building fabric and future work here should aim to explain the many puzzling features of the layout. Some attention should also be paid to the source of barley, and to the process of distribution of the maltings' output, which is not understood at present. A malthouse on the corner of Monks Road and Broadgate, on a site later used by the Monks Brewery, also began in the carcass of a medieval building (RAZ 10.29) and this conversion will be a matter of great interest, especially in comparison with St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall. Unlike St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall, however, the Monks Brewery site also included a complete brewery, and consequently the process here can be followed from the malting through the brewing stages. The brewery was demolished to make way for St Hugh's Church (RAZ 11.98).The Packhorse Inn Maltings, Wigford Yard (Herridge 1999, No.5013) may represent the next stage in the development of malting in the city. The standing couching house building is thought to date from the 18th century, although further survey work is required to confirm that this is the case. It is shown on a plan of 1827 and is probably the malting house associated with the Packhorse Inn (Patrick 1998). The gabled roof of large sandstone tiles/slates is unique in Lincoln and is likely to have been part of the temperature control system. The site is of especial interest because it represents a stage of the industry when malting was closely tied to the production of beer on the premises of each public house. Consequently it is the physical and artefactual connections between the maltings and the Packhorse Inn which should dominate in future recording and research work on this site. Consequently the boundary for this sub-RAZ includes the site of the inn itself as well as the maltings complex. The Bracebridge Brewery was established by the time of the 1st edition O.S. map behind the large Inn (now The Plough) which stood at the western end of Bracebridge Bridge. This may be an example of a pub-brewery, primarily brewing for the pub itself, but exporting its surplus. This is, obviously a different scale of operation from Dawber‰Û¡ÌÝå»s or the Crown Brewery and should be compared with such large operations. It is likely that more ancient, hand-made techniques survived longer at sites such as Bracebridge.At Brayford Wharf North a group of two purpose-built maltings of 1860s/70s still stand, with rear yard and alley between (Herridge 1999, No.5478). The original ownership has not been established but it is known that the properties were sold by the maltsters Bass, Ratcliff and Gretton in 1906.

2397eed2-2e78-4666-a0fc-16f5fcaa5eaa,LARA RAZ AREA,,The Cathedral,"Much more than any other Lincoln monument, Lincoln Cathedral has been studied by a battalion of scholars for more than 200 years. The High Medieval Era was the main period of construction at the Cathedral. In the pre-Conquest period, the site was occupied by the church of St Mary of Lincoln, about which virtually nothing is known. Any information about this major building will be of the greatest interest. Following the Norman Conquest the new Romanesque cathedral was one of the great buildings of Norman England, but with the additional complexity of an apparently unique suite of palace halls attached to, or shortly in advance of, the west front of the nave. This building was considered too small, however, and at the end of the 12th century a major rebuilding was begun at the east end. The building which survives today is largely a product of that re-building, largely completed once the central tower was completed c.1311.Between 1998 and 2001 the Cathedral commissioned a pioneering Conservation Plan, which summarises the academic background for every aspect of its heritage. It establishes relative importance for every conceivable aspect of the Cathedral's fittings and fabric and points clearly to the research priorities and methodologies which should guide work here in future. The Cathedral has adopted the Conservation Plan which, inter alia, recommends extensive archaeological recording, both above and below ground, in conjunction with all repair and conservation programmes. Consequently, to avoid unnecessary duplication, the user is simply referred to the larger study (Gibbs (ed. (2001).",Summary,The RAZ is bounded by the footprint of the Cathedral itself and the cloister and chapter house to the north.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.52,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.52,

In the Roman era, however, a case can be made that the zone of springs, and the streams and pools that developed from them along the northern cliff face, were regarded, at least initially, as foci of ritual interest (RAZ 6.13). It is perhaps somewhat unlikely that such rituals will have been initiated by the Roman incomers and, as we have good evidence that the pools and/or the river channels along the Witham itself were regarded as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáspecial‰Û¡ÌÝå» from the late Bronze Age (RAZ 5.2), we should be alert to signs of earlier ritual activity at the pools and springs in the northern cliff face. The presence of pools on the first terrace above the river itself has been hypothesised on the basis of results from LIN73a-c and LIN73f, but it is possible that at least some of these pools were themselves parts of the river channel itself. We have no indications at all that any springs in the cliffs to the south of the river gap were treated in a special way at any period, but this should not mean that the possibility is not considered here also.",Summary,"The western and eastern boundaries of this RAZ follow arbitrary lines along the modern Victoria Street down the cliff face to the Brayford, and the line of the modern Jellicoe Avenue to the Witham. To the west of the former line and to the east of the latter, we have no evidence for human interference with springs.

24685441-f1fd-477a-807e-c4bbcd9a029a,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Mary-le-Wigford,"Along with St Peter-at-Gowts (RAZ 9.60.28), St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is the best known of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s medieval parish churches and, like St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s it is a complex fabric which is only partly understood. Unlike St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s however, and like St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s retains an important collection of at least seven fragments of 10th- or 11th-century graveyard monument reused in its fabric (Everson and Stocker 1999, 211-7) and this ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáexceptional‰Û¡ÌÝå» collection of material has been used as the basis of an argument, based on parallels elsewhere, that St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (and St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s) belong to the earliest phases of the establishment of churches in Wigford (Stocker 2000). It is argued, not just that St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s was founded in the second half of the 10th century, but also that it was founded not by a local lordling, but by a larger group of members of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s mercantile elite. This provocative theory, based on the detailed evidence from St Mark's and on the few facts known about St Mary's requires more rigorous testing. In particular any works inside the church need to be undertaken in controlled archaeological conditions, so that the sequence of development of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s can be compared with St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. Similarly it is clear that the fabric of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s contains a great deal of information, and all repair and restoration works there must be accompanied by programmes of archaeological recording. In the graveyard, also, this question of the relative status of the interred in the 10th and 11th centuries can also be addressed, but only if a valid sample of the burial ground is excavated totally. It is important that the lesson is learnt from the St Mark's excavations and that the whole burial ground is eventually analysed as a single site. The architectural development of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, like that of St Benedict indicates a prosperous parish from the 11th through to the 14th century, and although the architectural structure and details of the church are worthy of study in their own right, they should also be seen against the wider economic, social and ritual background of churches in Lincolnshire and England. To the south of the modern church a portion of the graveyard has been adopted by the railway. This was an interesting area of the graveyard because it is another example (like those at St John Wigford - 9.60.23 and St Botolph - 9.60.21) of a rectory which may have been built within the churchyard. If it was constructed on the graveyard the prospect exists for an early sealed population below the rectory structure - which will be of interest in its own right in comparison with the church houses at St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Botolph and with other secular buildings in the suburb and elsewhere (RAZ 9.33 and RAZ 9.34 etc).",Summary,The boundary of the graveyard is known from early mapping and the RAZ includes its whole extent. Parts of the graveyard now lie under both St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street and the railway track and service work to either should not be undertaken without appropriate archaeological recording.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.26,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.26,

24def6cb-d8f7-4d21-ba24-4723a7251329,LARA RAZ AREA,,"Fossdyke, Brayford and Witham navigations","The Fossdyke Navigation (Herridge 1999, 25, No.5338) had been presented to the city of Lincoln by an act of Parliament of 1671 (Hill 1966, 126). There were frequent problems of flooding and silting but its use increased after improvements were made by Richard Ellison, to whom it was leased in 1741, and son Richard after 1743 (Wright 1982, 33-5). It was deepened in the early 19th century and in 1840. The Fossdyke was used at this time for the transport to Lincoln of coal, lime, cotton, linen and woollen goods, timber and pottery etc. and for the export of cattle, wool, wheat, barley and flour to the towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The GNR took over the lease of the navigation in 1846. Commercial water transport gradually declined with increasing competition from railways, but survived longer on the Fossdyke than on the Witham. Barkers and Lee Smith were the last Lincoln users of river barges, and the last active water transport company was Furleys of Gainsborough.The re-establishment of the Fossdyke by Richard Ellison in the 1740s, following the grant of his 999 year lease by the City Council in 1741, probably had more effect on the city than any single action in the previous three hundred years, but these effects are almost all visible in other RAZs. Within the canal itself we should be looking for signs of innovative engineering investment which characterised so much of Lincolnshire water-management in the second half of the 18th century (Wright 1982, 39-51). This was undoubtedly private investment and instructive comparisons might be made with public water-management schemes elsewhere (such as those on military schemes like the Royal Military Canal - or the works on the River Lea at Waltham Abbey, undertaken as part of the development of the Royal Gunpowder Mills there - Cocroft 2000). Research agendas for canals in England can be found in Hadfield 1973 and their relationship with canals in the rest of the world is considered in Hadfield 1986. A listing of internationally significant monuments has recently been provided by ICOMOS/TICCHI (1996).After the re-edification of the Fossdyke, the Brayford Pool (Herridge 1999, 25-6, No. 5374) became a major node on the Lincolnshire transport network, with wharves and warehouses, mostly privately built, lining its banks (RAZs 11.2.1, 11.2.2). The silts in the artificial pool bed should present a complete contrast with the silts of earlier Eras, given the changes in water-flow brought about by the water control measures, and they may also contain interesting evidence for changes and degradation of the environment brought about by industrialisation to the south-west and west, in the Trent valley and the West Riding.It was in this Era, also, that the River Witham was canalised to provide an effective means of transportation, drainage and source of water. It enters Brayford Pool at the south-eastern corner and leaves it at Brayford Head, before continuing along Waterside, through Stamp End and eastwards; it then turns south-east before Bardney and runs to Boston, reaching the Wash at Clayhole (Herridge 1999, 26, No. 5345). The lower Witham, below Lincoln, was used by vessels to reach the sea en route to London and elsewhere, not only from Lincoln, but also from the Midlands via the Trent and Fossdyke. By 1750 the Witham was in a serious state of disrepair with broken banks and regular flooding. Between 1762 and 1770 improvements were made, including the reconstruction of Stamp End lock (RAZ 11.1), a new sluice at Boston and the re-cutting of the channel through the fens to remove the meanders between Chapel Hill and Boston. The shallow and narrow section at High Bridge was improved but continued to cause problems. When the river was high there was insufficient headroom under the bridges and porters were still used to carry goods by road from Brayford to Stamp End well into the 19th century. Further improvements were carried out 1812-1830s. In 1846 the Witham was leas",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the banks of the waterways themselves, as mapped on the 1st edition O.S., but it includes a 5m length along each bank which is intended to include the structure of the bank itself.

25066a2f-99da-468a-a115-f8942afa34d9,LARA RAZ AREA,,Cathedral graveyard south-east of Angel Choir,"In the second half of the 13th century the Dean and Chapter relocated their cemetery from the west and north-west of the Cathedral to the area south of the new Angel Choir (Jones et al., 1987, 5). The land was acquired about 1264 and became (as one might expect) a burial ground used especially by the clerical elite (Stocker 1985a). It is not known when burial ceased here, but it is thought to have occurred well into the Early Modern Era. Although the burials here suffered from road works in the 1880s, parts of the graveyard survive in excellent condition and provide an important population for the study of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s clerical elite. The burials will also be useful because of the cemetery‰Û¡ÌÝå»s known date of inauguration - all burials here will be later than 1264 - and this will prove useful for the precise dating of any artefacts deposited with the burials. Patterning within the graveyard is also an issue. Preliminary excavations here showed a clustering of the burials close to the south-east transept and the suggestion was made that this was caused by a desire for burial either close to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáshrine‰Û¡ÌÝå» of Bishop Grosseteste or to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáJudgement Porch‰Û¡ÌÝå». Investigations in the remainder of the graveyard should be aimed at recovering information about preferences within burial location. It is not clear when burial ceased in this graveyard, but no burials seem to be recorded here after the Reformation.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include the whole of the area presumed to have been occupied by the graveyard (although its precise boundaries are not documented).

255d8ca0-e6fd-44c0-bf8b-1247249d284b,LARA RAZ AREA,,The sewer system,"The elaboration and expense evident in the management of water supply to, or from, Nettleham (RAZ 7.17) is also evident in the famous sewer system of the upper city. Wacher pointed out (1995) that the sewer system in uphill Lindum was particularly impressive by British standards, but the only evidence for sewers lies in the small, restricted, space within the upper city, which was mostly, if not completely, occupied by ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» buildings. The upper city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s baths buildings were large and would have disposed of great quantities of water. Furthermore both of the known north-south alignments of sewers are in places suitable to carry water directly away from the baths block in the north-east corner of the upper city, so it seems likely that the sewers are related to the bath house complex. But it is only our modern stress on individual hygiene that pushes us to see bathing as a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» matter, and therefore to see waste-water disposal as something ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå». We have already stressed the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» character of bathing within the upper city (RAZ 7.16) and, consequently, it may not have been the sheer quantity of waste water which led to the size and quality of the sewers in Lindum, but the fact that it had played a part in public rituals. Clearly, then, the analysis of silt specimens from the floors of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásewers‰Û¡ÌÝå» will be of great interest and their content needs comparing with deposits of comparable waste deriving from more clearly ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» contexts. Large gains in our understanding of the sewer system can be obtained straightforwardly and with little cost, using micro cameras and other prospecting equipment and this work should form an early priority.",Summary,"The boundaries of this RAZ are difficult to define, as only short lengths of the system are known. The boundaries are drawn on the assumption that the known sewers continue in their documented directions until they meet the main north-south street in one direction and the north-south alignment emerging from the south and of the bath complex on the other.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.18,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.18,

In this case, however, we have a record of the donation to the prebend by Henry Ist in 1115x1116 (ed. Foster 1931, 43-4, No.67) and this is probably not an indicator of a particularly early date of foundation. The church (and, according to Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s researches, the whole parish also -chapter 9a) is clearly on the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáback-lands‰Û¡ÌÝå» behind the High Street and so we might think it more similar in origin to St George or St Andrew and so, perhaps, the foundation belonging to a (presumably small) urban estate. Despite the church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s status as belonging to the prebend of All Saints Hungate, it seems little known and may not have been very large or wealthy. As it disappeared sometime in the 15th century, the sealed graveyard population is likely to be of considerable interest and similar questions should be addressed as at St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (RAZ 9.60.35) and St George‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (RAZ 9.60.40).",Summary,"Since Sympson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s time, the church site is thought to have occupied the north-east corner of the junction between Park Street and Mint Street (e.g. Venables 1888, 337). The east and south boundaries remain uncertain and an early priority for further work is to establish exactly where the churchyard does lie. Although this identification of the site seems to be correct, it does imply that the parish was not amalgamated with St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, when redundant, but with St Peter-at-Arches (contra Hill 1948, 144).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.43,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.43,

The church had originally been built somewhat earlier, in 1876-7 (to designs by James Fowler of Louth), as a chapel of ease. The plan of the building, along with its architectural details and fittings, represented the state of doctrinal thinking at the height of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s industrial prosperity. Fowler's own doctrinal position and its impact on his architecture is considered in Kaye et al. 1992. Consequently, further archaeological work at the site should be accompanied by recording programmes aimed at comparing such details at St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s with similar details from the extended medieval churches and with contemporary new buildings, like St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s West Parade (RAZ 11.92.5). In this way we can chart how thinking on the great doctrinal issues of the day were being handled by different faith communities in the city.",Summary,The RAZ includes the church plot mapped on the 2nd edition O.S. map.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.92.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.92.2,

27c32edf-90b1-4365-8c05-20e0cf06e431,LARA RAZ AREA,,St John Newport,"St John Newport is one of an interesting group of churches in Lincoln, and in England more generally, which seem to have been founded within a market place or street, presumably to provide both a parochial focus for market traders living along the edges of the market and also to provide a spiritual patron for the market itself. Such churches are the spiritual guardians of the market places in which they sit. In this case, the church can provide information for the foundation date of the market. The church is first recorded in 1123-48 ( ed. Foster 1931, 197-202, RA 252) and it has a graveyard (i.e. burial rights), yet it sits in the middle of the road, and so is unlikely to have been founded prior to the market itself (a conclusion which can also be deduced from its clearly ‰Û¡ÌÝÌájunior‰Û¡ÌÝå» status with respect to St Nicholas Newport - RAZ 9.60.2). This must mean that the Newport market is at least as old as the early 12th century; furthermore it may well be that the foundation of the church and the establishment of the market were contemporary events. Discovering the date of church foundation, therefore, might provide critical information about the establishment of the entire Newport market. The pattern of rebuilding may also provide a helpful index of the rise and decline in importance of the market, although such relationships are rarely one-to-one and care must be taken to avoid a simplistic connection between the size of the church and the size of the population accommodated.",Summary,"The site of the church is known, and is represented by a platform on the western side of, and within, the modern road south west of Bishop Grosseteste College. The north-west and south boundaries of the RAZ follow the lines of the close indicated by Edward Willson as the churchyard (London, Soc. Ants. Ms. 786, vol.5, 43), but the eastern boundary of the churchyard certainly lay further east than the 19th-century close boundary, and it is drawn to include the width of the modern road. Note that the close indicated is shown as being outside the parish of St John in Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map. This transfer of the former church site to the neighbouring parish was undertaken at enclosure, again according to Willson.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.1,

27d9462f-2db6-404b-b852-314965ef48a5,LARA RAZ AREA,,The High Market of the lower city and other lower city markets,"We know virtually nothing about the layout of markets in the city prior to the Conquest. Dr Vince has suggested, very plausibly (chapter 9a), that during its early stages of development the city markets were held within each of the streets, and he is keen to see the Clewmarket as a late medieval remnant of this arrangement (RAZ 9.23.1). However, at some stage it is clear that the markets became grouped together in the streets on the steepest part of the hillside, in the area least easily usable for settlement, and this will not have happened before the streets on the lower hill slopes had been re-planned in the early 11th century.With the exception of the Clewmarket, then, the markets of the lower city in the period from the 12th to the 14th century can be grouped together because they were all held within streets adjacent to each other on the steepest part of the hillside. The poultry market was evidently held near the church of St Martin in the mid 14th century, along with the hay market and the butchery (Hill 1948, 364), but references to the upper part of Steep Hill below the High Market being known as The Poultry or Poultry Hill suggest that it was moved there, perhaps during the 15th century (RAZ 10.22.4). The corn market was immediately to the south, at the foot of Steep Hill, where it is joined by the Strait and the hay market was around the church of St Martin. The Butcher‰Û¡ÌÝå»s market or shambles was to the east, at the point where the Strait joined the High Street (Hill 1948,361). The drapery market (for retail sale of cloth to the local area) was in the road now known as St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street, and the skin market was at the foot of Michaelgate where it joined Spring Hill. All were held, so far as we know, within these adjacent streets themselves, rather than in purpose-made market squares, and it is this close proximity on the least favourable land in the medieval city which presses us to consider how such a market zone on the hillside might have developed. In terms of classic plan-form analysis, this part of the city stands out as distinctively different from the street plan of the lower part of the lower city. On the slope, there is a fan-shaped zone of streets spreading out southwards from the south gate of the upper city. The fan is defined to the west by what was once a continuous lane which originally turned north-eastwards at the top end of Beaumont Fee connected with the narrow lane (partly preserved in Gibraltar Hill) which ran along the north side of the churchyard of St John-the-Poor. To the east the fan-shaped area was defined by the modern Danesgate, or a predecessor in this location. Within the fan, between the these two streets, the property blocks stand in marked contrast to those further south. They are irregular and form a variety of triangular and lenticular plots which contrast markedly with the very rectilinear property blocks further south. Superficially, one might attribute this irregularity to the steepness of the hill slop at this point, but this does not explain why this part of the hill slope was developed at all, and with such fine properties, when it would have been much easier simply to expand the lower city east and west further down the hill.Dr Vince has demonstrated that the lower city and the upper city developed as two quite independent foci of occupation until they eventually united in the later 11th or 12th century. The two settlements were eventually joined by the development of this fan-shaped area on the hill slope, but the question is, what was the mechanism by which was the junction was effected, and does the presence of markets in the streets here in the later Middle Ages provide us with the vital clue? Dr Vince has already pointed out that the skin market, the corn market and the drapery are all located towards the northern end of streets which he has good reason to think formed the northern ends of the primitive street grid of the early Anglo-Scandinavian set",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ are established through plan-form analysis and are drawn along the north-western side of the former lane north of St John-the-Poor and along the north-eastern side of Danesgate. The line of the southern boundary is taken to be Danesgate east of Ermine Street, as this marks a clear end to the rectilinear pattern on this side. However to the west of Ermine Street the southern boundary of the putative proto-market is less easy to identify.

280f27c5-d16b-4a29-af31-4baf72a483fa,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Eastgate suburb (and the Close within St Margaret Pottergate Parish),"In the consideration of the open fields (RAZ 9.9.1) it is suggested that the suburb might have been laid out over part of the east field. Although it might be quite difficult technically, it is a point of such importance that effort must be made to see if the soils below the earliest occupation levels here were the result of cultivation. Equally the fills of any boundary ditches lying below occupation levels here will be of great interest and value. In parts of this suburb a great deal is known because of the exceptional survival of both houses (especially in Pottergate) and of documentation (where the properties belonged to the Dean and Chapter) (Jones et al. 1984). In other parts, however, we know next to nothing. It is highly likely that there were medieval domestic buildings lining the southern end of Northgate and the northern side of Langworthgate. Dr Vince suggests that the properties on the northern side of Langworthgate may originally have been laid out at a single moment in a primitive grid aligned on a vanished road that originally ran north, rather than south, of St Peter Eastgate. This hypothesis can only be tested by excavation, ideally across property boundaries. Several of the standing buildings along the north side of Eastgate have ancient-looking boundary walls and these should be investigated to establish their character and date. The buildings themselves were not covered by Jones et al., and refurbishment work in them should be accompanied by building recording. It is not known how far east suburban properties extended, although if, as we have argued, St Giles‰Û¡ÌÝå» Hospital had its origin in a parish church founded in the 11th or 12th century (RAZs 9.58 & 9.60.7), we can suggest that properties of this general date may have extended out at least as far as the hospital site. We should also, presumably, look for similar properties this far out of the city on the south side of Wragby Road, although no documentation has survived for any such dwellings; both of these areas were subsequently greatly affected by quarrying (RAZ 9.41.2). Closer to the market place, it is highly likely that the block of property between the north-south section of Wragby Road and St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane was occupied by properties in the Medieval period, and we can suggest that such properties would have fronted on to the short side of the triangular green. No.2 St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane is an early-post-medieval building and may conceivably contain some fabric of this period. More importantly, perhaps, the property may be that subject to a series of charters in the mid 13th century (ed. Major 1973, RA2715-21, p.45-50). An excavation here might therefore benefit from dated horizons. Along the south side of Greetwellgate and the north side of Winnowsty Lane, properties can be presumed in the medieval period and, in the northern extension to Winnowsty Lane (made when the Close Wall was created), there is the prospect of recovering some precisely dated stratigraphy. Further west, at the western end of the original Winnowsty Lane, made redundant when the Wall was built, domestic properties ought to survive in the gardens of the properties south of Eastgate without any alterations made after c.1300. Within the late medieval Close Wall, there ought to be well-preserved and important deposits relating to the lane known as St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane, which runs to the east of, and parallel to, Pottergate. Properties relating to this lane will be of exceptional interest as Dr Vince has argued (chapter 9a) that St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane may represent a very early phase of development of the suburb, which was replaced by the fan-like layout of streets and the market before the 12th century. If there was any early Viking activity uphill, but outside the Bail, this is perhaps the most likely place in which it will be found. Pottergate and Boune Lane (The Greestone Stairs alignment) have been exceptionally well studied in Jones et al. 1984 and 1987. In both cases many f",Summary,"The various components of the RAZ are bounded to the east by the line of modern Wragby Road, which documentary evidence seems to indicate was the maximum extent of settlement in the suburb in the Medieval period.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.28,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.28,

28d8ee36-4fcc-498c-92c8-f5a0af289308,LARA RAZ AREA,,Artificial stone manufacturers,"Joseph Fambrini was a plasterer in the 1850s, who became a manufacturer of artificial stone and concrete in the 1860s in workshops first in Waterside South and then Newton Street, in what is now Sippers (formerly the Crown and Cushion) Public House and the adjoining property. He built a workshop at 85 Canwick Road in 1878, later developing into the show yard and offices of the company of Fambrini and Daniels. The surviving office building on Canwick Road of 1889 (Herridge 1999, No. 5518) is a two-storied building of red brick, with many decorative features in brick and terracotta, including the city crest on the north elevation and an 1889 date-stone on the north elevation. The architect was W Mortimer. From c.1913 to at least the 1930s the site was occupied by the Lindum Stone CompanyThe buildings themselves and the working spaces associated with them (some of which are mapped on the 1st edition OS.) are important survivals of this little-understood industry. We know little of the processes involved in Fambrini and Daniels' stone production, and something of these processes may be recoverable from the fabric of standing buildings, or from their buried plans or layout and from associated deposits (particularly if such deposits include production residues). Results from future work on this site could usefully be compared with the archaeological project mounted on the Coade Stone factory in Lambeth (Newbery 1978). It would be particularly interesting, for example, if we could show that they were using local clay (RAZ 11.42). Although not as famous as the Coade Stone works at Stamford (opened in 1858 - Birch 1999, 10-12), the chemical composition of Fambrini and Daniels' stone will be of considerable technical interest - especially if it can be compared with the output of rival companies. Examples of its use in their own building, or in others around the city should be noted and (where possible) investigated as part of any study of their factory.",Summary,The RAZ is defined by the boundaries of the works depicted on historic mapping.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.41.6,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.41.6,

293d21fc-4486-4ae9-9780-e8af8529e5da,LARA RAZ AREA,,High Bridge and ford,"The High Bridge at Lincoln is a structure of the greatest interest and importance in its own right (Herridge 1999, No.5319; RAZ 9.15; 10.15). A recent study has identified at least five phases of construction in the present building (Hall et al. 1984), the earliest dating to 1160, and including an extension to the east of 1880 and an extension to the west of 1800. Because the bridge is the very pivot around which the city turns, understanding this complexity will tell us a great deal about the sequence of development in the city as a whole. A research agenda for structures of this type has been established in the Step 1 Report (OAU 1998). All works, both to the tenements on the western side and to the fabric below road level, must be carefully monitored and recorded. The road surface itself also requires archaeological attention when repair or enhancement work is undertaken as earlier road surfaces, even those of the Industrial Era, may be of interest. The chapel, which had occupied the eastern side of the bridge, was removed in 1762/3 and an obelisk erected in the same position. The neo-classical obelisk was a structure of interest in its own right as it contained a faucet on the water pipeline, remains of which will survive below the pavement and will be of considerable technical interest. This faucet is said to have replaced an earlier one attached to the Stonebow (Herridge 1999, 5354), but it is possible that there was some sort of outlet here since the initial provision of the supply in the 1540s. Traces of an earlier faucet or tank at this location should be searched for in archaeological projects undertaken in conjunction with future repair and alteration work. The obelisk itself was removed in 1939. The reconstruction of the shops of the Early Modern Era along the west side of the bridge in 1902-3 by the Lincoln architect William Watkins is itself of interest as an early example of a conservative restoration of a timber framed building in the city (Mills 2001a, 5). The bridge was built alongside a paved ford, which can only have passed finally out of use in the 1770s or 1820s, when the navigation link between the Brayford Pool and the Lower Witham was improved. The sequence of events leading to the closing of the ford, in the Industrial Era, will therefore also be an index of the improvement of the navigation, and consequently will be worth recording.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include not just the presently visible bridge structure but approximately 20m to north and 100m south in order to incorporate the full extent of the surviving buried abutments.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.6.5,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.6.5,

29a820b0-5bff-4e8f-9673-a5ddbade95b3,LARA RAZ AREA,,Stamp End causeway,"The Stamp End causeway (RAZ 5.2 and 6.4) seems to have been of little account during most of the Roman period, or at least, Roman deposits have not been identified in association with it. However, there are Roman metal-work finds associated with it, which may suggest that its earlier ritual significance had not been entirely forgotten. Future work should concentrate on trying to understand the extent to which this earlier monument played a serious part in Lindum‰Û¡ÌÝå»s ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» life during its first three centuries.In the 4th century, however, it is clear that the pattern of use of the river changed, with hards being built along the south wall of the lower city and this area being opened up to commercial traffic. Such activity is likely to have had some impact on the Stamp End causeway. Having been marginal, once again the causeway may have become more central to the life of the valley-floor settlement in the 4th century, and we might expect to find not just important remains of hydraulic engineering works, but also the evidence for some ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» ceremonial marking of the place.",Summary,"The boundaries of the causeway in the Colonia Era are no more certain than they were in previous eras and furthermore, the causeway almost certainly changed lines many times throughout its existence. The RAZ is intended to include, not only the causeway structures, but a strip at least 100m wide to either side, because it is in the adjacent zones next to the causeway structures than most votive deposits associated with it have been discovered.

29b7d0be-cfae-4308-8557-07b3d7ddce78,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Hospital & Prison Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌHospital and Prison Character Area is dominated by two public services with large uptakes of land, Lincolnshire County Hospital and Lincoln Prison. A number of residential developments have been built in infill locations around these two main uses. The area is located on the eastern side of the city, either side of the busy Greetwell Road, in what was once a fringe location but is now within the built up area of the city.The expansive developments of the Prison and Hospital complexes have over-written much of the former rural character of the area, although some traces of field boundaries and areas of former extraction have been retained in the townscape. Both Hospital and Prison have undergone successive stages of alteration and extension, creating a complex and telling story of the provision of services to Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s growing population since the late 19th century. Many of the original buildings survive at the centre of the expanded complexes, providing a full cross section of their history since foundation.The hospital and prison account for the majority of land in the Character Area. These are complexes of buildings set within large plots. In the case of the Prison many of the buildings are obscured from view by the tall imposing security wall around the perimeter of the plot. Within the hospital there is a coarse grain of attached buildings and extensions at varying orientations within the overall plot, often with little relationship to each other or the road. Due to the low level and large footprint of many buildings, and extensive areas of car parking, large parts of the area have a horizontal emphasis. There are several visitor entrances within the hospital but no clear focal point, making it disorientating for visitors. Residential developments have been built in infill locations. They are generally detached and semi-detached properties in rectangular plots aligned perpendicular to the road with a setback to the front for either a garden or driveway. Properties off St. Anne‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Close are set around a courtyard with communal parking and grass verges.Fine grained plots and small-scale houses within residential areas contrast with the large scale and sprawling developments of the Hospital and Prison, resulting in a fragmented and incoherent townscape. Large amounts of the Character Area are open space, including extensive areas of car parking but also an area of maintained grassland and the prison exercise ground, both of which have restricted access. There are also many grass verges and areas of green space within communal housing areas and the hospital grounds. The majority of residential properties have private gardens to front and/or rear. In places the public/private boundary is not clearly defined and marked only by a grass verge. There are many types of street furniture in the public realm, particularly road and visitor signage, bollards and controls on parking areas.The area has a high vitality, partly as a result of vehicles using Greetwell Road to get into and out of the city but particularly due to the high volume of staff and visitors using the prison and hospital. Residential areas are quieter but remain active for more of the day and into the evening.

Although the earthwork butts themselves will only be represented by ephemeral archaeological remains, we might expect a scattering of smaller features, which have been only rarely encountered. These might include stake holes for targets and other aspects of range management and, particularly, an assemblage of arrow heads which will be of great value for typological study and may tell us something about the development of the long-bow in the late Middle Ages and later.",Summary,"The precise location of the Shooting Leas is uncertain, but it was reached by means of a causeway from Newland gate and this might suggest a location along side the River Till/Fossdyke in the area south of Carholme Road.

2a84d85e-ecd5-46bf-aa67-fdb6f06efb38,LARA RAZ AREA,,Lower City (City) Assembly Rooms,"Partly in imitation of the County Assembly Rooms of 1744 (RAZ 10.46.3, RAZ 11.70), city society began to raise funds to build their own assembly room in the lower city. The result was that an assembly hall and other chambers were added to the new Buttermarket (RAZ 10.22.8) which was under construction north of the Civic Church of St Peter-at-Arches. The Buttermarket had apparently already been completed, as a single storey structure, so the new Assembly Room was added on top and this two-phase, dual purpose, building was demolished in 1938. From the original layout of the buildings it should be possible to understand the way in which the elaborate social interactions in an Assembly Room were managed. Each different space will have been carefully fitted and decorated to indicate the relative social status of the occupants, and future work should aim at elucidating this elaborate pattern of social spaces. Although they arose from very similar social circumstances, any differences in function between the use of County Assembly Rooms compared with the City Assembly Rooms will be of great interest, as it is probably true to say that the distinction between the two social groups is not well understood. The upper floor of the Buttermarket was used for meetings, a newspaper room and a library by the Mechanics Institute once they had been displaced from the Greyfriary building in 1858 (Hill 1974, 58, 276) (RAZ 11.55). By the late 19th century, however, philanthropy had become a more civic concern, and the upper floor of the Buttermarket building became the public library shortly after 1891 (Hill 1974, 227-8). As this was on the upper floor of a building demolished in 1938, there will be few archaeological remains. Even so the plan can be reconstructed from documents and should be compared with the much more elaborate building provided with a grant from the Carnegie foundation in 1910 (RAZ 11.72). The RAZ has the same boundaries as the Butter Market (10.22.8).",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the boundaries depicted on the 1887 O.S. map editions and includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.71,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.71,

It is not clear that any fabric at all survives from the late medieval phases of the church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s history and fabric analysis is urgently needed to understand the relative ages of the features in the wall which survive today. The impact of the Reformation on the liturgical arrangements in the church will be given added interest as the church was under the close supervision of the Bishop and the Dean and Chapter, and it will be instructive to see what sort of impact the new liturgy of the Reformation made on the close itself. The church was extensively repaired in 1638 (Sympson 1906, 330), then wrecked in the Civil War and rebuilt in 1695. Some fabric of this date survives today, although much dates from the reconstruction of 1882. As any surviving fabric of the 17th century will be of great interest, all repair and reconstruction works here must be accompanied by detailed archaeological recording. This is the most extensive surviving ecclesiastical building of this date in the city and, having distinguished the phases of the surviving fabric, it is important to gather evidence for changes in liturgical layout throughout the 17th and 18th centuries in this the parish church most directly influenced by the cathedral. It may also be the most convenient place in which to study the damage caused by puritan iconoclasm in 1644 and subsequently and this should be a research aim of future work.The burial population of the Early Modern Era is not likely to be large, but, as the parish consisted mostly of houses in the western part of the close, those buried within the church itself are likely to be elite individuals. To the east of the church is a small open space (in front of modern Exchequergate Lodge), which may have provided some space of burial. The parochial graveyard, however, was south of the cathedral nave and will provide a relatively complete sample of the population of the close throughout the late medieval and Early Modern Eras (included as a detached part of this RAZ).",Summary,"The RAZ includes the whole of the modern church site and graveyard which is thought to be the same as that of its medieval predecessor, as well as the detached graveyard south of the Cathedral nave, which is defined using early mapping.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.32,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.32,

2ba000ec-7cf3-4de6-b137-2be4aab401c0,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Lindum Terrace Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌLindum Terrace Character Area is a mainly residential area located on the upper slopes of the northern escarpment. Houses in the area are often orientated to take advantage of long-ranging southerly prospects off the escarpment ridge. The area is dominated by large-scale residential villas that, as a group, illustrate a period of great growth, prosperity and affluence during the 19th century.From the Post-Railway Expansion period parts of the area began to be developed as a residential suburb. As Lincoln prospered with the arrival of the railways and a new industrialised economy, many houses belonging to an emerging middle-class elite were built in the Character Area, many of which survive. However, many of the larger plots have been sold off in a piecemeal fashion, enabling their infill by a number of smaller properties. Several of the larger buildings now function as part of a larger complex associated with the hospital or Lincoln Minister School.Buildings are semi-detached or detached, are large in scale and set back within large garden plots, resulting in a low overall density of buildings. They are highly individual in design and are often differentiated through large-scale changes in form, as opposed to small-scale decoration, although many features are accentuated in stone and to a lesser extent brick. Many of the plots are surrounded by extremely tall boundary walls, which emphasise the exclusivity of the area and lead to a high sense of enclosure along streets. A number of houses have retrospective architectural features, including neo-classical and Tudor elements, although some properties are more typical of the period of their construction (e.g. Arts and Crafts). The varying architectural style of houses partly reflects the competing opinions towards the Gothic and Classical styles during the late 18th and 19th centuries, known as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáThe Battle of the Styles‰Û¡ÌÝå». Later houses, usually in the form of infill development of one or a group of houses are comparably plainer and smaller in scale. The properties are built within smaller plots, which are defined by lower plot boundaries. The houses are often similar in form and decorative style which contrasts with the more eclectic mix of architectural styles elsewhere in the area.Many original features of the public realm survive from the Post-Railway Expansion and Late Victorian/Edwardian Periods, retaining the context for the development of the array of grand villas. The area also appears very green as a result of well-established plants and trees in the large, mature gardens which contributes to its suburban character.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 77,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,32,

It was evidently dismantled at that time, however, and an archaeological appraisal of the site should address the twin questions of how viable the building fabric was when it was demolished and, if possible, whether or not it was in active use at that time. In other words, had the city by 1546 worked their way through all of the genuinely redundant churches and were they, at St Stephen‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, resorting to making churches redundant simply to make money for themselves?",Summary,"The location of the churchyard is known.

2d7826d3-db9f-4a37-886e-be6cd127bdb0,LARA RAZ AREA,,Intermediate road routes,"These roads connected Lincoln with smaller towns and villages in the county and played an important part in establishing Lincoln as a regional market centre (RAZ 9.12.2; 10.12.2). Only one such road led into the southern part of the city, the road to Canwick and villages beyond. This road became much more important after 1839 when the modern Canwick Road was built extending from the bridge over the Witham at the southern end of Broadgate to the Washingborough Road (Mills 2001b, 138). Although there was a turnpike up the hill as far as Mill Lodge from 1774 (Ibid.), in 1846 the slope up Canwick Hill was addressed, opening up a reliable route to Branston and the villages along the Fen edge. A toll was charged at the new crossroads at the foot of Canwick Hill (RAZ 11.7.2). Eastwards from the road junction at the foot of the hill, the medieval road to Washingborough and Bardney crossed the cemetery (not laid out until 1856, when the road was diverted - RAZ 11.98) before following the line of modern Washingborough Road. The improvement of roads in this quarter of the city might be associated with the beginning in the 1840s of the growth of iron works on the floodplain land to the north, between Washingborough Road and the Witham, and it may be possible to judge from the archaeological remains of road surfaces of this era whether these new roads were intended to carry exports from such factories. It is also the case, however, that this new route provided a simple bypass, avoiding the High Street-Clasketgate through-route, from the south to the north connecting with the New Road, and this might have been an equally influential stimulus to the development. The roads which linked the village of Boultham to the Newark Road to the south, to Skellingthorpe, Doddington and North Hykeham to the west, and the road from Bracebridge south to Brant Broughton, should also to be considered in this category of intermediate route, although these roads were never turnpiked. North of the city similar ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáintermediate‰Û¡ÌÝå» roads occupied the lines of Greetwell Road, Wragby Road, Nettleham Road and the road(s) to the west of the Castle. To the north-west of the city, Stowgate and Cliffgate (RAZ 10.12.2) continued in use as an important routeway to the west. Long Leys Road seems to have been diverted north of the original Cliffgate line, skirting around land belonging to the House of Industry (constructed on the site of St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church - RAZ 9.60.3 & 10.60.3), and then entered Newport via what is now Rasen Lane (marked as Newport Road on the Enclosure Award map). Of these roads the Lincoln-Dunham Ferry road was turnpiked in 1756 whilst that to Wragby was turnpiked early on, in 1739. All of these roads were inherited from earlier eras and chronological patterns in their repair may be detectable, allowing some comparison to made of the weight of traffic carried to and from these various locations.",Summary,The RAZ includes the lines of the roads as depicted on the 1st edition O.S. map and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.7.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.7.1,

2e791d2d-b1ed-4b02-a1fd-6563e95043d6,LARA RAZ AREA,,Gowts Bridges,"The two important drainage dykes, Great and Little Gowt, have been identified during the course of Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work as the likely original southern boundary of Upper Wigford (above chapter 9a; RAZ 9.14). The Speed map of 1611 shows that, before canalisation, the Little Gowts Drain (south of the Great Gowt) was actually a tributary, leaving the Witham slightly upstream of its companion and rejoining the Great Gowts east of Ermine Street, and before the combined channel flowed into the Nichorpool. Today the Little Gowt is culverted beneath High Street, but the survival is likely of important structures relating to early modern crossing points of both drains on the line of the main street. These are likely to be of importance, not just because their construction will be an important indicator of transport, and therefore occupation activity in Wigford and in the city more generally, but also because they are likely to be waterlogged, offering the prospect of well preserved wooden remains. Speed‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map shows an arched stone bridge like that over the Great Gowt, and this may be an early modern stone bridge it is known that both Gowts bridges were repaired (perhaps under the patronage of Thomas Wolsey) in 1531 (Hill 1956, 24). The bridging point of Little Gowt may be better preserved than that of Great Gowt. The more northerly Dyke was crossed by two single-carriageway arched stone bridges, which may have been of late medieval date and one or other abutment should survive in the ditch side to one side of the modern dual carriageway bridge (built shortly after 1806 (Hill 1966, 175). The bridges at both Great Gowt and Little Gowt seem to have been created alongside fords. Such fords also have considerable archaeological interest in their own right and are often paved, providing a useful dating horizon. The RAZ is flanked by the churchyard of Holy Cross Wigford (RAZ 9.60.16, 10.60.16) on its western side. The relationship between the two structures is of great interest and importance and therefore the two RAZ boundaries are intended to have a substantial overlap.",Summary,The RAZ boundaries are drawn with the intention of including both any surviving physical remains of the bridge abutments for what are potentially four bridges and their associated fords.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.14,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.14,

This earlier usage, and the dry, flat, site would have made this area particularly attractive to domestic and commercial settlement, and we suspect, from the form and size of the east gatehouse, that this was the main entrance to the upper city. Consequently, perhaps, this is the prime candidate for an area of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» housing; yet we know virtually nothing about occupation in the area. Research into the character of domestic occupation here in the Colonia Era should be a priority. To the east of the lower city there was a suburb developed in the area known in the medieval Era as Butwerk. As Mr Jones notes (chapter 7a), it may have had an industrial character, with evidence for iron smelting being found at the Broadgate site (BE73). Any such industrial development here would be of considerable interest, not only because of the opportunity it would provide to look again at Roman metallurgy, but also because sites here may allow us to investigate the complete process from quarrying to manufacture of iron objects. Ironstone outcrops in the cliff face here, (RAZ 6.22, 9.41.2). Although it is not of a good quality, these deposits may have stimulated the industry here.",Summary,"The western boundaries of this RAZ are taken to be the eastern edge of the defences along the east wall of the upper and lower city. The north and north-east boundaries describe an arc linking together the three known Roman roads and keeping the recorded sites of burial to the east. To the south-east the boundary follows an arbitrary line down the cliff face to the Witham. The line selected was used in the High Medieval Era (RAZ 9. 51.2) to define the eastern suburb, but there is no reason to think that the Roman suburb was defined in such a way.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.11.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.11.3,

2f058764-b936-4352-8c9f-248f7b16a554,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Spring Hill Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSpring Hill Character Area is situated on the slope of the north escarpment and the gradient of the slope has heavily influenced both the development of the area as a whole and the design of individual buildings within it. This is an entirely residential area with two main types of building, large detached and semi-detached houses and terraced housing. In the far north of the Character Area and either side of Beaumont Fee are a number of large detached and semi-detached Victorian/Georgian properties. The cutting of terraces into the escarpment later enabled further development to take place on Gibraltar Hill, Stanthaket Court and St. Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Terrace. These areas also contain predominantly large detached and semi-detached properties. Although there are a few Victorian terraced houses along Hungate and at the corner of St. Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Terrace, unusually the majority of the terraces are recent developments set around a courtyard, often with a private gated entrance such as Cordage Court, The Ropery and St. Cuthberts Court. Since its initial settlement during the Roman Colonia Era, the Character Area has undergone several stages of redevelopment, most recently during the Modern Period. Despite the consecutive stages of development, earlier townscape elements survive, including the route of the Lower Roman city defensive walls, the medieval layout of streets, and the plot boundaries of former medieval churches.It is the position of this Character Area on the slope of the north escarpment that gives it its unique character with long views both up to the Cathedral and out over the lower city and south escarpment. With the exception of some of the properties in courtyards and a couple of detached cottages behind the terraces on Beaumont Fee, all the buildings in the Character Area have been orientated north-south to take advantage of these views. Their design, too, has been heavily influenced by the position of the properties and features such as balconies, terraces, glass extensions and bay windows are common, particularly at first-floor level. Integrated garages are a common feature of the modern houses as this enables the living rooms, terraces and glass extensions to be built at first-floor level where, because of the gradient, nearly all properties are able to get uninterrupted views out over the city.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 3,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,37,

Although evidently a part of the layout of Lower Wigford, it sits between Holy Cross (RAZ 9.60.16) and Holy Innocents (RAZ 9.60.17), which mark the two extremities of the market space, but unlike St Botolph (RAZ 9.60.21 - which also sits between these two churches - there is no reason to think this an early or pre-existing foundation. Indeed it is possible that this church might post-date the establishment of the market, although whether it post-dates the construction of the Sincil Dyke in the later 11th century is unknown. A notable structure within the medieval parish was the hall called Blyton Place and the chantry of the Blyton family was in the church (Hill 1948, 152, 168) indicating that the estate (known as Blytonland - Cameron 1985, 138) was closely connected with the church. Future work on the site might address the question of whether the founder of Blyton Place was also the founder of the church and conversely whether the church started life as the estate‰Û¡ÌÝå»s chapel.",Summary,"The site of the churchyard of St Margaret has been reconstructed from early leases and the RAZ aims to include the plot defined by such documents.

30c36730-9254-43ca-b230-2c07d431535e,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Newland Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌNewland Character Area is located on low-lying land between the base of the north escarpment to the north and the Brayford waterfront to the south. The townscape in the area is highly varied, reflecting a complex historical development since the Roman Eras. The area includes Newland itself as well as land either side of the road.The area straddles the line of the walls of the lower Roman city, which were later extended south to the Brayford waterfront during the High Medieval Era. The walled extension along the line of Lucy Tower Street first established Newland as the western gateway to the lower fortified city, and formed the basis of a medieval market and suburb lying immediately outside of the city walls. The area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s location immediately north of the Brayford Pool, coupled with its status as a market place and western gateway to the city, encouraged strong links with river-going trade and transport along the Brayford. The association between the area and the waterfront is still apparent in many areas of the townscape.During the Early Industrial Period, the area was resettled as a high status suburb, and several residences survive in the current townscape. The houses are relatively large scale and emphasise the former prominence of Newland. The properties are comparatively more ornate with loosely classical decorative elements, stone dressings and bay or oriel windows. The buildings are relatively rare in Lincoln, with few other properties, let alone groups of buildings, surviving from the period. Eastern parts of the area are a mixture of industrial and working-class housing mostly of Late Victorian/Edwardian date.Newland continues to serve as a busy road in the west of the city centre. Linked to major relief roads to the east and west, the role of the road has increasingly become that of a thoroughfare rather than a gateway to the city. Several buildings have converted rear yards for car parking, shifting their main entrances to the rear. In addition a number of buildings on the Brayford have their rear exits out onto Newland, leading to a sense of inactivity at odds with the role of Newland as an historic gateway. The blocking-out of windows either through internal screening or the boarding-up of vacant premises exacerbates the issue and contributes to the poor use of some pathways.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 75,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,53,

30e9d967-4166-4b37-93e9-3e7bd9c4a916,LARA RAZ AREA,,Willingthorpe Manor,"Like Butwerk, Newland may incorporate an early independent estate centre (see RAZ 9.29). Unlike the Monks' Abbey estate, however, the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s manor of Willingthorpe seems to have become physically absorbed into the suburb as it developed westwards to join it, even though the estate remained a distinct legal entity (Hill 1948, 328-9). The focus of the estate centre is very likely to be in the vicinity of St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church. Questions to be asked of this estate centre have more to do with debates in rural settlement archaeology (Everson 2000). In terms of topographic location, the settlement appears to be in exactly the same spring line location as all of the parish centres along the Lincoln Edge to the north. It is approximately 3 km south-east of the next nucleated settlement near the spring line, at Burton (Everson et al. 1991) - a similar distance from Burton as the next settlement to the north at South Carlton. Was Willingthorpe, therefore, a nucleation of the late 9th or 10th century, like Goltho/Bullington 10 miles to the north-east (Beresford 1987; Everson 1988). Can it even be considered a nucleation at all, as Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s location within the Central Settlement Province (CLNSC) would suggest is likely (Roberts and Wrathmell 2000)? The presence of St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church, apparently serving the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s soke here at Domesday, probably does suggest that this is a nucleation of the type found in other settlements along the spring line, but, if the settlement was nucleated in the 10th century, we need to know whether it was based on an earlier (i.e. pre-10th-century) focus or whether it represents a new plantation of that date. Although it seems likely that the settlement had its origin in a rural community, by Domesday it seems that there were burgess-holders here (Hill 1948, 61-2). This instance of what looks like a rural manor, where some tenants held by burgage tenure is extremely unusual and it is important that we investigate the types of properties which were occupied by such rural burgage holders. Were they really 11th-century commuters into the city as our current understanding of the scope of such tenures would suggest?Although it seems that Willingthorpe rapidly became indistinguishable from the suburb of Newland more generally (RAZ 9.31) (and presumably all its properties were eventually held by burgage tenure rather than by manorial service), the single reference to the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Garden at Willingthorpe (RAZ 9.32.2) is extremely important as it suggests that the Bishop not only owned the manor but maintained some sort of house here. Presumably, therefore, the manor was focused on a complex of high status buildings and the recovery of information about these will be of great interest.Although it seems clear that the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s property here continued into the 14th century, Willingthorpe as a settlement may have been an early casualty of the changing economic fortunes of the city and between the city and its hinterland, as it is not heard of again after the mid 12th century (Cameron 1985, 46). The reasons for the disappearance of this manor from the documentary records are of great interest, especially if they result in the conversion of manorial rights in the vill into some kind of burgage tenure, but it is likely that any such developments will have occurred in the High Medieval rather than the Early Modern Era. Any research within the manorial curia should, therefore, be structured to investigate such matters as the changes in such matters as plot size, boundary status or other architectural features which might indicate a shift in the legal status of properties. It should be remembered that the manor was a legal entity not a physical one, and therefore any changes in layout of tenements anywhere in Newland, which might represent a change in the legal status of the building will also be of very great interest as they could represent property belonging to Willingthorpe manor but located outside the curia.",Summary,The RAZ boundaries are based on the knowledge that the church of St Faith (RAZ 9.60.15) is thought to have been located within a rectilinear group of closes marked on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map. It is hypothesised that this is the location not just of the churchyard but also the curia of the manor - but there is absolutely no evidence for this and all research at the western end of RAZ 9.31 should be aware of the possibility that the capital buildings of the bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s manor might be located outside this area.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.32.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.32.1,

315720cb-4b21-49b4-beda-89045176a5be,LARA RAZ AREA,,The aqueduct,"The internationally important remains of the aqueduct system in Lindum have been more frequently discussed than any other aspect of the colonia‰Û¡ÌÝå»s archaeology. However, in Mr Jones‰Û¡ÌÝå» discussion he has indicated that the great bulk of this research and discussion has been utilitarian in stance (chapter 7a); questioning the possible and likely length of pipe lines, the capacity of different types of Roman pump and the drinking-water needs of the Roman population. But what do we actually know about the aqueduct? Merely that it is a pipe-line, which could have flowed in either direction, given sufficient siphon pressure at one end or the other, connecting the upper city (a place of undoubtedly ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáritual‰Û¡ÌÝå» significance) with a famous spring (the Roaring Meg). Many scholars have observed that the upper city at Lindum did not, in fact, need water transported from a spring three miles away; it had excellent water supplies of its own, both from wells and from springs in the hill side. Surely, therefore, the obvious conclusion is that the water which travelled along the pipe-line was itself special in some way - probably in a ritual way. This would certainly explain the extraordinary expense of enclosing the pipeline in an elaborate concrete jacket and it might also explain why the water was not transported in an open canal, as it was in all of the other genuine water-supply aqueducts in Britannia. Furthermore, the Roaring Meg spring might, itself, have been the seat of power, the Nemeton, of the native god Mars Rigonemetos, a Pre-Roman deity whose name indicates an association with a sacred grove (a Nemeton), many of which also contained springs, and which may also have had an oracular function (Henig 1984, 18, 51). We know of Rigonemetos through the inscription found in Nettleham village 2 km north-east (1961 (Whitwell 1970,124). This inscription was found in a secondary location, but it originally dedicated an arch at the entrance to the temple enclosure. The temple of Mars Rigonemetos might have been located originally at the spring, but the late Roman road leading north-east from the fortress (RAZ 7.1) heads, rather, for a location 1 km north-east of the spring, where Mr Everson has recorded a cropmark site at the point at which the alignment of the Roman road joins the Nettleham Beck. The temple site recorded by the inscription, whilst still drawing its strength from the LPRIA spring, may have been re-located further along the river later in the Roman era. The aqueduct, then, might be seen as a pipeline between two ritual sites, but which way was the water flowing? F.H. Thompson (1954, 110, 113) took the fact that the pipes were laid with the joints ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáfacing‰Û¡ÌÝå» Lindum to mean that the water flowed from the spring to the city. But this view is based on experience in laying modern drainage pipes, which don‰Û¡ÌÝå»t have a concrete jacket. For a pipeline inside a concrete jacket it is immaterial which way round the pipes are laid. The ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáspecial‰Û¡ÌÝå» water could have flowed either way within the pipe therefore, and we have to use more contextual information to help us with this issue. We know from the inscription that the Nettleham temple complex associated with Mars Rigonemetos was also associated with the same Numina Augustorum, the cult of the Emperor, which will have formed the centrepiece of temple worship in the Forum itself, and this prompts the speculation that the water flowed, not from the Roaring Meg spring into Lindum, but the other way; from the upper city to Nettleham. In flowing from the colonia to the sacred grove, the water would be flowing from the temple precinct of the Emperor‰Û¡ÌÝå»s cult to the sacred grove of Mars Rigonemetos. It might have been seen as flowing, then, from the seat of the novel sacred power of the Roman state towards the seat of the equivalent pre-Roman deity - an excellent, but entirely typical, example of the superimposition of the Roman gods on existing native cults. The symbolism permitte",Summary,"The boundaries of this RAZ include the known line of the aqueduct and a boundary of 50m either side to ensure that any associated features along its line, such as the various generations of Nettleham Road, are investigated in conjunction with it and not in isolation.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.17,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.17,

They were formed naturally when quarrying finished on the site in the 1960s. Around the lakes there are areas of heathland and woodland, as well as several paths. This provides a variety of spaces that are enclosed to differing degrees and have habitats at varying stages of development, for example woodland that is starting to re-grow after clearance. The sides of the lakes are mostly overgrown with vegetation, but there are occasional views through the undergrowth and across the lakes. In some places there is access directly to the water‰Û¡ÌÝå»s edge.There is an interesting variety of habitats at Swanholme. For example, there is heathland at different stages of development including sandy heath, willow carr and sphagnum bog. The area is important ecologically because it supports a wide variety of aquatic and heath plants and wildlife, especially dragonflies, damselflies, birds and reptiles.Surviving landscape elements from earlier periods include the former quarry pits that are now filled with water, several remains of quarry buildings and structures, and an old spoil heap. There are also drainage channels from the drainage of the wetlands in the early 19th century.Swanholme Lakes feels separate from nearby residential areas and the city centre itself. There are few landmarks to orientate oneself, with the exception of the high-rise apartment block, Jarvis House, which is visible from several parts of the site. It is also quiet and there is no road access except via a track from Hartsholme Country Park. Swanholme Lakes is an important piece of open space for people in neighbouring residential areas and for Lincoln itself because of its amenity, recreational and conservation values. Good pedestrian access is provided to residential areas to the east and west and the area is well used by people walking, jogging and enjoying the lakes. However, there is evidence of litter and vandalism, including previous fires. Together with Hartsholme Country Park and the Skewbridge Character Area to the north, Swanholme Lakes forms part of an important continuous area of green space stretching from the southern city boundary to the northern boundary, also taking in Burton Fields, Boultham Mere and West Common.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 14,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,97,

Early Roman structures or artefacts along the northern riverbank to the west of the causeway would therefore be of very great interest, because unexpected, and should be sought in any exploration opportunities. The proximity of such structures might be revealed by systematic environmental sampling within RAZ 6.7, even if the structures themselves were not.",Summary,"Only the western boundary of this RAZ (which it shares with RAZ 6.12) can be suggested. As with RAZ 6.10 the northern boundary is likely to be the sharp break in slope at the foot of the cliff, which here occurs approximately on the line of West Parade. The southern boundary has been drawn along the modern river bank, but it is not known how much further north the Roman bank was located. The location of the western boundary is entirely notional.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.11,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.11,

Between 1998 and 2001 the Cathedral commissioned a Conservation Plan, which summarises the academic background for every aspect of its heritage. It establishes relative importance for very conceivable aspect of the Cathedral's fittings and fabric and it points clearly to the research priorities and methodologies which should guide work here in future. Consequently, to avoid unnecessary duplication, here the user is simply referred to the larger study (ed. Gibbs, 2001).",Summary,The RAZ is bounded by the footprint of the Cathedral itself and the cloister and chapter house to the north.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.52,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.52,

The modern bridge of 1924-5 replaced a ramshackle causeway and bridge of seven arches. Disputes over responsibility for different parts of this structure continued into the 19th century (Hill 1948, 357-8; Herridge 1999, Nos.5323 & 5088). By this time the arches were evidently all of different dates. When and how the final repairs to the old bridge were undertaken in the late 18th and 19th century is a matter of some interest, illustrating the pattern of traffic over the bridge, and the structure of the 1924 abutments should be searched for evidence of the previous bridge. The steel reinforced moulded concrete structure of 1924 is of engineering interest in its own right and should be recorded in detail during repairs and alterations. A research agenda for structures of this type has been established in the Step 1 Report (OAU 1998). As a vital artery, the City Council sometimes shouldered responsibility for repairs, but frequently they expected other parties to share the costs with them.",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include not just the area of the modern bridge, but also lengths of the causeway 100m long on either side, which continued in use into the 19th century. The width of the RAZ is wider than the modern road to ensure that any minor changes in the alignment of the causeway or bridge are included.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.6.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.6.2,

3416d8a6-22f2-4074-a886-94f1b8c561eb,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Martin,"St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s had been one of the most interesting and important church sites in the city in the High Medieval Era (RAZ 9.60.38), and it has Early Modern Era importance as well. The church continued to be one of the most important through the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, attracting for example, the foundation of the Guild of St Martin in 1338 and the Resurrection Guild c.1374, whose altars or chapels may be detectable archeologically (Westlake 1919, 168). The church also attracted elite patronage by wealthy individuals and occasional gifts to its repair (e.g. John of Toynton in 1431 - ed. Gibbons 1888, 164). With the burial of Seman Grantham in 1452, however, the church became the burial place of members of the Grantham family, who were buried here throughout the 16th century in the chapel - which they may have built for the purpose north of the chancel . This chapel sounds directly comparable with those at St Marks, St Mary-le-Wigford and St Benedict, but may be of even greater interest as we know more about the family which built and used it. In the early 16th century there are several bequests to building work on the tower (in 1505 and 1508 - ed. Foster 1914, 24-5, 37). This is one of the very few Lincoln examples of major new building in a parish church during this century and as such deserves careful study. It also must indicate something about the status of the parish and its parishioners, that at this time of economic hardship for the city as a whole they could embark on such a project. As the church survived the Reformation, it should retain important evidence for the liturgical re-ordering required in the 1540s, but of even greater interest is the documentation suggesting that these Protestant alterations were reversed in the 1550s during the Marian reaction (Hill 1956, 59). Because of the survival of this documentation the story of the changes brought about in worship during the Reformation can be studied more effectively here than at any other church in the city. We have no information about damage or iconoclasm in the Civil War and Interregnum, but as few city churches escaped, such damage should be sought archaeologically. In the 18th century the church should also preserve evidence, quite rare in Lincoln, for the re-orderings associated with the Georgian church. By the 18th century, however, St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s emerged as the only city church to rival St Peter-at-Arches and a fine neo-classical tower was built in 1740 (HMC 1895, 117). Only at St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is it possible to obtain information about construction and engineering methods for such major buildings on the eve of the Industrial Revolution. With its potentially early population, St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s will preserve an important group of burials and, as it continued in use for burial until the 19th century, it must preserve one of the longest sequences of burials in the city. It is a site, then, which offers the prospect of understanding the development of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s physical anthropology through a very long period of time.",Summary,"The south boundary of the RAZ is drawn along the expected south boundary of the churchyard where it is indicated on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map. The west boundary is presumed to lie on Hungate; the east boundary must have lain originally more or less on the line of the properties fronting High Street, whilst the northern boundary is presumed to lie along the south side of Garmston Street",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.38,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.38,

3426168c-efe8-4828-a73b-3973e935f6a5,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Castle Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Character Area incorporates Lincoln Castle, a landmark building located in a strategic position at the top of the north escarpment, and a number of buildings lying outside of the main walls that fall under the influence of the Castle. The area is part of the core of the upper city, which, alongside neighbouring areas, forms part of an identifiable neighbourhood on the north escarpment, the townscape character of which is strongly influenced by developments spanning the full history of Lincoln.Buildings and open space within the Character Area are used for a wide variety of purposes. The Castle is a key tourist attraction and event space, but continues to house the functioning County Courts. Properties outside of the Character Area are a mixture of residential and commercial buildings. Car parks around the periphery of the Castle serve both local and visiting populations.Some of the principal surviving historic features in the current townscape include the alignment of the former Roman city defences, the 12th-century Lincoln Castle and its associated earthworks, and the medieval road layout around the Castle, parts of which may have earlier Roman origins.The Castle is a large and impermeable urban block around which buildings and streets within the Character Area are orientated. Building scale varies, with large buildings including the Castle and those within its walls, in addition to groups of smaller-scale properties outside of the ramparts. The overall building density is low, with few buildings located within the main keep, and those outside of the walls sited within a large number of open car parks. However, there is a high sense of enclosure, as the townscape within and outside of the keep remains dominated by the tall Castle curtain wall.The Castle consists of a single-storey quadrangular curtain wall within which are integrated several mainly defensive features of two to three storeys in height, including two large towers, which sit on elevated earthen mottes. Walls and buildings are constructed of coursed and squared limestone, with some areas of herringbone rubble, and have a high solid-to-void ratio with very few windows or doorways. The curtain wall has a crenellated parapet and wall walk surfaced in York stone with areas of coarse concrete infill.The Observatory Tower is three storeys in height with a high earthen motte, and rising stepped curtain wall to each side. The lower two storeys are square in plan and have a stringcourse, crenellated parapet and single lancet windows and some arrow slits on the south faÌÎå_ade. The upper storey is a later round tower with stepped rectangular windows, crenellated projecting parapet and rooftop viewing area.Lucy Tower to the west is polygonal in plan with plain buttresses, consolidated parapet, and a northeastern gateway with inner segmental arch. The hood mould with billet and scallop motif is a later 19th-century copy from the Cathedral. Cobb Hall is comparatively smaller, and is rounded with slit windows in deep recesses and a vaulted roof.Within the Castle keep, the Assize Court is built of ashlar masonry with hipped and gabled slate roofs and crenellated parapets. The building has a three-bay wide projecting centre, central four-arched doorway, and three first-floor two-light windows. On either side there are five-bay width arcaded passages with five two-light windows below three smaller lancet windows at first-floor level. On the ends of each arcade is a single-storey stone pavilion with a single lancet window. Corners of the building are accentuated with tall crenellated octagonal corner turrets. The Old Prison and Governor‰Û¡ÌÝå»s House include a chapel and exercise yard with enclosing wall. The Governor‰Û¡ÌÝå»s House is brick-built with stone dressings and hipped slate roof, and is H-shaped in plan with a seven-bay width central range flanked by two bay wings. The property is three storeys in height with five-side wall and five ridge chimney stacks. Windows are multi-paned six above six vertical wooden sliding sashes, except on the upper floor, which are three above three. The Old Prison is located to the rear of the Governor‰Û¡ÌÝå»s House, and is linked by a single-storey chapel. The prison building is brick-built and is three storeys in height and 15 bays in width, with regular small windows, and a central canted bay window to south and west. The building has a shallow pitch gabled roof in slate, with two large ridge chimney stacks. To the south of the prison is a small semi-circular exercise yard enclosed by a tall brick wall with chamfered stone coping.The Castle keep is taken up by open areas of lawn, mature trees and deep borders that extend up the ramparts around the perimeter of the inner Castle walls. The overall effect is one of mature and landscaped parkland. The centre of the keep is entirely lawn, with the exception of the sunken area of car parking to the west. Externally, ramparts are more scrub-like in appearance.Car parks at the foot of the exterior Castle ramparts provide an open setting for much of the northern and eastern earthworks and Castle fortifications. The car parks are surfaced in tarmac and are defined by brick walls set into the base of the Castle ramparts or walls associated with the boundaries of building plots.Properties outside of the Castle walls are mostly 19th and early 20th century in date, except for a small number of Modern properties. Buildings are two to three storeys in height and two to three bays in width, and are mostly built of brick facing the road.Two small groups of early 19th-century terraces consist of small development plots with cottages built of red or yellow brick, which are set at the back of the footway. Roofs are of clay pantiles or replacement concrete tile, and have plain eaves and verges with their ridgelines running parallel to the road. The cottages are plain in style with small square or vertical multi-paned sash windows. Window lintels are either single cambered brick arches or segmental brick header arches. Some cottages vary slightly in height, exposing short sections of their gable ends, giving a stepped effect.Mid to late 19th century properties include two short terraces of 10 and 3 houses and a number of individual developments. Properties are built of red-brick, and are set back 2 to 3m from the footway, although two public houses are three storeys in height and set at the back of the footway. Buildings have medium-to-high solid-to-void ratios with wooden or brick canted/rectangular bay windows at ground level, and mainly wooden multi-paned vertical sash windows above. Doorways on terraces are located within shared passageways. Terraces are generally plain, with some simple decoration, and have gabled roofs in Welsh slate with ridgelines parallel to the street, several of which have gabled dormers.Roads are mostly two lanes in width with 1-3m wide pavements in tarmac with concrete kerbs, although some narrower streets have pink granite/York Stone setts and York stone pavements.

On the hillside, there is little evidence that the steep slopes were occupied by houses at all until the later Roman period. As we have seen (RAZ 5.4, 6.13), in earlier Eras the springs in the hill side itself may have been valued for their sacred significance, and there is some evidence that this significance continued into the early Colonia Era (RAZ 7.19). In some of these cases the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» houses of the later Roman period may have replaced ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» springs. The grand house known on the corner of Michaelgate and Spring Hill, for example, seems to be a fine ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» house which was preceded on the site by a use which is represented by what appears to be the ritual burial of an amphora. The housing in the lower city offers an important opportunity to investigate a second potential appropriation of space - when the new elite charged with provincial government arrived in the 4th century. As yet we have very little information which illuminates this major change in the function of the city. It is possible that the new elite brought with them even more ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» establishments and Mr Jones thinks that they may have pushed out some of the existing occupants of the lower city into Wigford (chapter 7a). Such a discontinuity (occurring in the 4th century) ought to be well-marked in the archaeological record but it has yet to be documented.",Summary,"The RAZ is constrained by the late walls of the lower colonia.

The plant was a commercial /industrial laundry and dyers and some earlier buildings remain in use as part of a modern laundry. This is a relatively early surviving example of a plant belonging to this service industry and is consequently of some considerable interest. Certainly the surviving early buildings need to be recorded before major repair or alteration and it may be possible at that stage to identify the original layout of the site.

The RAZ includes the areas of the Roman burial grounds as these extensive remains must have posed problems for the Anglo-Saxons.

3526a189-c329-497e-b338-484d2bb57dae,LARA RAZ AREA,,Houses in the Bail (and the Close within St Mary Magdalene‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish),"The character of occupation housing within the Bail in the Anglo-Scandinavian period is a point under active discussion at present, and future excavation may further the debate. Dr Vince has shown (chapter 9a) that the castle founded in 1068 occupied the whole of the area within the Roman upper city (see also Vince and Stocker 1997; Stocker forthcoming a) and this raises the question; what type of occupation was established within the enclosure when William I appropriated it? The evidence is scarce and documentary sources permit little more than informed speculation. Evidence from excavation is also sparse, being essentially confined to the layers associated with the small sunken building created in the eastern part of the cemetery of St Paul-in-the-Bail in the late 10th or 11th century. Dr Vince, however, points to the thin scatter of later Anglo-Scandinavian pottery in the Bail and interprets this sunken building as part of a commercial complex extending back from a predecessor to Bailgate (chapter 9a). I would point out, however, that there is no reason why this sunken building has to be interpreted as a commercial building and that it could just as easily form part of an aristocratic haga (especially as it is associated with smithing ). This putative haga could be one of several within the walls of this ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáreserved‰Û¡ÌÝå» enclosure, each with its hall, support buildings and church/chapel. These various foci within the enclosure may have been linked by a road which curved gently from north-west to south-east across it. The very existence of this road and certainly the date at which it was laid out should be easily testable through small carefully sited sections across its line. Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s interpretation would mean that a substantial ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáurban‰Û¡ÌÝå» population was dispossessed in 1068, and this is, of course, the initial impression created by the Domesday statement that the castle occupied the space of 166 houses. However; recent work on Domesday Book tends to interpret such figures as statements about taxable units rather than actual houses, and viewed in this light, the Domesday account is silent on the nature of occupation in the upper city. It is merely reporting that the taxable value of the site is equal to 166 ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhouse-units‰Û¡ÌÝå». Instead of interpreting the 166 houses of Domesday literally, then, I would emphasise the continuity between the elite of Anglo-Scandinavian Lincoln and the elite of the early Norman period. All further work in the Bail needs to be informed by this important debate, reflecting, as it does, a wider debate about the impact of the Norman Conquest.Dr Vince and I both agree that following the Conquest there was a period of about 70 years (1068-c.1135) during which the upper city was devoted to the military and ecclesiastical elite, after which the construction of the present castle enclosure permitted the construction of modern Bailgate and the establishment of ranges of commercial tenements along both sides (Vince and Stocker 1997; Stocker forthcoming a). Excellent evidence survives for these buildings in the form of surviving fabric and early documentation (Jones et al. 1996). Initially these tenements on Bailgate were of the highest quality, mostly built of stone and some with fine architectural detailing, but towards the end of the Middle Ages buildings were of timber and became less substantial in quality. All evidence gathered from the building‰Û¡ÌÝå»s fabric will add to our picture of both the development of commercial and domestic architecture in the city, but as this collection of buildings is outstanding nationally, every detail needs recording for us to be able to understand better the development of urban architecture generally. The Bailgate buildings might be able to throw light on the problems recently posed by Harris (1994) about the extent to which parts of the buildings, other than the ground floor chambers on the street front, played a role in the commercial use of such ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáshops‰Û¡ÌÝå» (see also Cl",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include the entire area within the upper city walls. Not all of this area will have been occupied by housing at any one time, and it is likely that there are areas which have never seen domestic occupation. But it is important that all future investigations within the enclosure engage with the issues of the character of domestic occupation here at the different periods within the High Medieval Era.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.24,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.24,

357ef761-5877-45b1-a3cc-2990b4d5ccf3,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,The Lawn Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Character Area is situated on the north escarpment, north of Carline Road and extending east and west off Union Road. To the west of Union Road is The Lawn itself, a collection of former asylum buildings with a variety of modern uses set in landscaped gardens and with associated car parking. To the east is a row of terraced houses that at one time may have been used as a half way house for the staged release of patients from the asylum. The large-scale two-to-three storey buildings in The Lawn complex, and the Castle wall, contrast with the small two-storey terraces on Union Road.The Lawn is surrounded by a mixture of stone and brick walls of differing heights, with black railings in some places and, for the most part, mature trees and planting. This creates a coherent urban block including both buildings and grounds. The terraced houses form a separate block that is connected to The Lawn both by their physical proximity, overlooking the eastern side of the complex, and by their former use. The Character Area contains large areas of open space and car parking within the grounds of the former asylum. The open space includes landscaped gardens, mature trees, a play area and a walled garden. The gardens reflect a belief in the importance of fresh air and exercising for mental well-being. The choice of planting around the boundary wall gave privacy and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprotected‰Û¡ÌÝå» patients from outbreaks of enteric fever further south. The main building within The Lawn was built as a lunatic asylum in 1819. It has a grand neo-classical faÌÎå_ade that is rendered and has an imitation blockwork pattern. The original building consisted of the main faÌÎå_ade, including projecting terminal blocks, vertical sliding sash windows and a portico with pediment, plus two single-storey wings extending perpendicular to the faÌÎå_ade. Over a period of more than a hundred and fifty years, there have been several phases of expansion including extensions to this building and the construction of others within the grounds. These included adding a first floor to the wings and a hall to the rear, creating a quadrangle. A new entrance porch was also added to the east wing in the late 1980s when the building was converted into an events/conference venue. A roof was also added to the quadrangle as this time to create the main conference hall. A large conservatory that is open to the public and dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks was opened in 1990.Charlotte House represents one of the phases of expansion during the site‰Û¡ÌÝå»s history. It was built to provide a nurses‰Û¡ÌÝå» home and children‰Û¡ÌÝå»s unit in the 1930s. It is an H-shaped building in red brick with three storeys and a narrow balcony to the first floor. There are vertical sliding sash windows to the first and second floors, and round arched windows on the ground floor. This building was refurbished in 2007 and is now a hotel.The perimeter of the former hospital with its variety of wall materials, railings and trees creates a definitive boundary to this part of the Character Area. This results in a strong sense of enclosure. It also means that the main building does not have as much of a visual impact as one would expect from such a grand faÌÎå_ade because it is largely concealed from view. This is partly the result of its setting within the grounds. The main faÌÎå_ade faces south on to the trees along the southern perimeter and the current entrance is from the east. The Lawn complex contains a number of uses including an events/conference venue, several shops, offices, a hotel, and grounds that are open to the public for recreation including a play area, walled garden and conservatory.The Lawn is not very well connected with surrounding areas. This is a feature of its former use as an asylum. The high walls and railings with limited entrance points, combined with the mature trees and planting around the perimeter of the site, mean that there are limited views into and out of the site. The main entrances are all situated along Union Road, in quick succession, providing access to the car parking in the east of the site. These entrances are unclear and understated. There is no free public access through the West Gate of the Castle in the adjacent Character Area, further separating The Lawn from the Castle/Cathedral area. On the eastern side of Union Road, looking on to The Lawn, is a row of terraced houses. These retain many original features such as tiles and dado rails in the recessed doorways, and windows with two single-pane vertical sliding sash windows separated by a turned mullion. The houses are of red brick with a moulded course beneath the eaves and two projecting courses beneath this.

35bdbdcb-cd30-4091-90d0-0512fe24a15f,LARA RAZ AREA,,Holy Cross Wigford,"Some aspects of this church might point to an early date amongst the Wigford churches, whilst others suggest that it comes late in the sequence, being fitted into a pattern of parochial provision at a late stage. The church occupies a key site in the development of the secondary suburb of Lower Wigford, located just south of the bridges over the Gowts. It is, therefore, in a comparable ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásenior‰Û¡ÌÝå» location within the lower suburb to the churches of St Nicholas Newport (RAZ 9.60.2), St Peter Eastgate (RAZ 9.60.4), St Rumbold Butwerk (RAZ 9.60.9) and St Stephen-in-Newland (RAZ 9.60.14) and, like both St Nicholas and St Peter, it stands at the town end of a great market street. This location might make one suspect a relatively early foundation date, at least compared with the other three churches in Lower Wigford (St Margaret (RAZ 9.60.24), St Botolph (RAZ 9.60.21) and Holy Innocents (RAZ 9.60.17)), as might the fact that the church gave its name to a Cathedral prebend (ed. Greenway 1977, 93) - which Hill believes may be an indication that the church was acquired in the 11th century (1948, 146). But other points make one doubt that this church had any seniority within the suburb. In particular, it has a greatly reduced parish, as it shares with St Michael Wigford (RAZ 9.60.27), the distinction that its parish was confined to a single side of High Street (the west side) (pers. com. CPC Johnson, citing work on the Survey of Lincoln database). The site is crossed by Boultham Avenue and services works along the line of this main road should always be accompanied by an archaeological recording programme. Further work should focus on the exploration of the question of which of these two views of Holy Cross is the more valid.",Summary,"The location of the churchyard is known, and skeletons have been found on various occasions. The churchyard was bounded by the Gowts Drain on the north and High Street on the east. Its south and west boundaries are not known, but it is not impossible that the southern boundary lay along the north bank of the Little Gowt, making the church effectively the only building along the street front on the island formed between the two drains. The parish, however, probably extended south of the Little Gowt as there are documents relating to several properties on the High Street in addition to the church (ed. Major 1973, 298-304, RA2960-2966).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.16,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.16,

360e6bdf-131b-463b-9cff-e92339080c31,LARA RAZ AREA,,Quarries in the cliff face east of the city,"As with the likely quarries to the south and north-west of city, there is also very little documentation for quarrying of the cliff face east of the city. Nevertheless there is clear archaeological evidence for extensive early (though as yet undated) quarrying in the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌábenches‰Û¡ÌÝå» cut into the top of the hill side and now occupied by roads such as Lindum Terrace and buildings such as the Adam and Eve public house. Furthermore it is likely that the steep decline in the modern Upper Lindum Street owes its origin to quarrying cutting back into the cliff edge to create a workable quarry face. Substantial quarry faces are indicated immediately to the east of the modern Wragby Road as it broaches the top of the hill on Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1722, and there are references to an 'old stone pit' along the southern boundary boundaries of properties in Greetwellgate west of the junction with Wragby Road, in 18th- and 19th-century documents (pers. com. Joan Varley). But these quarry faces are of considerably greater antiquity and Dr Vince makes the excellent point (chapter 9a) that the original line of Winnowsty Lane seems to have been truncated by a northwards extension of just such a quarry face on the east side of Wragby Road occupying the land north of the Christ's Hospital School building. Furthermore, Vince also suggests that this cutting can be dated by the change in the street-name from Wainwellgate to Wainwellsty in about 1273. The locations of these quarry faces relative to the likely original profile of the cliff indicate that an enormous quantity of stone has been extracted here and it is highly likely that this was the source of most of the stone for the great city building projects between the 11th and the 14th centuries. Future research work in this area of the city between Wragby Road and Lindum Terrace needs to be aimed, initially, at understanding the sequence of steps by which the topography of this part of the city has been modified over time. Subsequently, because these represent such large-scale and apparently relatively well-dated operations, a great deal can be learnt about the development of quarrying techniques through time. A research agenda for this topic has recently been issued (LUAU 1996a). For example it is known that, in the 18th or 19th centuries, there was extensive adit mining into the stone deposits below the occupied land in Eastgate, small parts of which were explored using a remote TV camera in 1987-9 (WC87). We urgently need to know how early this more complex form of mining began.One late 12th-century document might refer to a quarry within this RAZ, which suggests that stone from here was not used solely for building. The Thurgarton Cartulary records a quarry given by Walter Villein to the Priory, probably in the 1170s (ed. Foulds 1994, 613, No.1083). It is not said where this quarry was located but, although he held isolated properties in several parishes in the city (and he lived in St Edmund‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish) Walter owned a number of houses in both St Peter ad Fontem and St Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parishes, east of the lower city and within this RAZ. Furthermore some of these houses seem to have been next to an ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoven‰Û¡ÌÝå» (furno), which is said to be held by him ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáof the quarry‰Û¡ÌÝå». This oven which is held ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáof the quarry‰Û¡ÌÝå» may well be a limekiln, and amongst Walter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s holdings, his property east of the lower city is the most likely location for such a facility. Some corroboration of the use of this area of the city for lime-burning at the end of the Middle Ages was provided by the limekiln debris from the northern part of the excavated area at Broadgate East (BE73). Furthermore, Rosemary Lane was known as Lime Lane in the 17th century, although Cameron believes that it was named after a 15th-century family called Lyme (Cameron 1985, 78, 93). If the cliff face east of the city was being used to win stone for lime-burning, this may suggest that the exposure was being operated as a commercial concern (as may have been the c",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn along the city wall in the west, to the west of which it is presumed that quarrying will have been restricted - though not necessarily prevented - by domestic development. The northern boundary is provided by the top of the cliff above the exposures. This line, of course, migrated northwards as the medieval quarrying removed more and more stone and the RAZ boundary includes the maximum likely extent of this quarrying by the 14th century. As Dr Vince proposes that the quarry face had reached the line of Winnowsty Lane in the 1270s, the northern RAZ boundary for this Era has been established along the south side of Greetwellgate. In later periods, of course, the quarry face moved further north still, and it may always have shared (at its western end) a common boundary with the area of stone digging identified as RAZ 9.41.3. The southern boundary of the RAZ is less clear-cut, as operations integral to the quarries themselves (potting kilns, limekilns, iron smelting works and stone-working areas) are either known or suspected on the flatter land below the foot of the scarp. The most southerly evidence for such activity (from Broadgate East - BE73) belongs to the Early Modern Era, but even so it provides a convenient point from which to extend the southern boundary eastwards until it meets the District boundary.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.41.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.41.2,

36624d35-d9ac-49dd-b351-5b46d71c0d62,LARA RAZ AREA,,Dominican Friary,"The four friaries of the major orders in Lincoln (Augustinian, Carmelite, Dominican and Franciscan) represent a good group by national standards, and in addition, Lincoln has a relatively rare example of a Friary of the Sack. The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In all four, of course, the churches and other claustral buildings will be of interest and plans need to be recovered, but we know a great deal about fraternal plans (e.g. Butler 1984) and attention should now be turning to more complex aspects of the archaeology of friaries. One of the new avenues requiring exploration is the study of burial populations at friaries; cemeteries will be of interest as valuable resources for paleo-pathology, but although we have a certain level of documentation about burials in the Lincoln friaries, we badly need a fully excavated graveyard to provide a proper sample. Some burials have been excavated under the Carmelite Friary, but it is not clear what percentage of the total they represent. These types of studies may be best targeted at the Austin Friary in Newport, which seems to be almost completely undisturbed. Consequently, any development proposals here should be accompanied by provision for the archaeological excavation of the complete church and burial ground. A similar opportunity may also exist at the Blackfriars, although the many reports of burials found here over the years suggest that this burial population may have been compromised already.The Dominican Friary, or Blackfriary, was a large and important house for this order, but relatively little is known about it. The boundary of the large precinct in Butwerk is known, although Dr Vince shows that it reached this size only in stages. The conventual buildings are shown by Speed and Stukeley to have been located in the south-western corner of this large area, near the junction of Holgate with Monks Road. These ruins were sketched by the Buck brothers (Oxford, Bodleian Library Ms Gough Lincs. 15, 31v) but although they show a length of wall with elaborate arcading and perhaps a vault, it is not possible to understand the plan of the convent.The friary was the recipient of royal patronage during its extended period of construction and this, along with the hints of vaulted buildings in the Buck sketch, might imply buildings of special quality. Certainly the house was both large and impressive enough to encourage both high-status burials (like that of the Archbishop of Armagh in 1320) and many return visits (at least seven) of the Dominicans‰Û¡ÌÝå» provincial chapter (ed. Page 1906, 220-1). Like many houses of friars the Lincoln Dominicans interested themselves in the water supply, and in 1260 they reached agreement with the monks of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey York to enclose a spring on the monks' land and conduct water away from it along the side of a road (presumably that which ran through the monks' estate (RAZ 9.55.1) - a continuation of Baggeholme Road ; now Monks Road) (ed. Page 1906, 220). If it could be discovered, as a dated conduit this is a structure of considerable interest and efforts should be made to trace it. The friary is also of importance because of the character of the site which it occupied. It was established in the mid 1230s on what was then presumably marginal land, but which had previously been the potters‰Û¡ÌÝå» sector (RAZs 9.40.1 and 9.41.2 - see also RAZ 9.29 and 9.18). Presumably the line of potteries along the cliff, south-west of Pottergate, had gone out of use by 1230, but we can guess that the fraternal buildings were laid out on terraces which the potters' clay-digging had cut into the hill side. As a former industrial site, this would not have been an attractive location for the friars, though it was one in keeping with their profession, and it may have been granted to them because of the difficulty of finding commercial uses for such a difficult site in a suburb which was already",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the whole of the extended precinct of the friary, and has been drawn using boundaries deduced from many documentary sources.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.53.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.53.2,

36a6d9bd-cbca-4a22-9a13-118065ac051e,LARA RAZ AREA,,The mint and jewellery quarter,"We believe we can identify an area north-west of Stonebow where, in the 13th century, there was a concentration of jewellers along with the mint (RAZ 9.37). However, the coin series from the Lincoln Mint came to an end in 1279 ( Hawkins 1850, 56-7; Mossop 1970) and, as this coincides with the start of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economic down-turn, we may suspect that it marks the end of minting in the town. In the 15th century there is a record of a building called le Cunynghouse in Mint Lane, which seems, subsequently, to have been known as the Mint Hall or ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáCoining House‰Û¡ÌÝå». It is hard to see what role such a hall would have played in the medieval Lincoln mint, however, and Prof. Cameron has shown that le Cunynghouse had nothing to do with ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácoining‰Û¡ÌÝå», deriving instead from the surname of the property‰Û¡ÌÝå»s owner (1985, 151). The idea that the building was something to do with the Lincoln mint seems to be an instance of back-formation of the place-name based on the knowledge that the mint was in this general area.Whether the end of minting was accompanied by a cessation in jewellery production more generally is a moot point. Certainly there are very few records of goldsmiths in Registrum Antiquissimum after c.1300, but the Registrum contains mostly 13th-century material anyway. Some evidence that there were not enough workers in precious metals to form a coherent group in the city by the mid 16th century is provided by the charter granted in the 1560s to a new grouping of tradesmen including the trades of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáartificers, smiths, ironmongers, armourers, spurriers, cutlers, horse-marshals and wire-drawers‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Hill 1956, 81). Although some exponents of these trades would certainly have been able to work in precious metals, the specific trade of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágoldsmith‰Û¡ÌÝå» had disappeared. Furthermore, with the shifting of boundaries between trades, there may have no longer been a specific area in which the members of these disparate trades could operate. We need to know what happened to the jewellers' properties in the former jewellery quarter and, particularly, whether they were turned to the production of non-precious metalwork. More generally we can ask whether there is a direct relationship between the disappearance of workers in precious materials in the city and the wealth of the city. Our evidence suggests that, even if it had shrunk in overall size, there were still plenty of wealthy members of the community - were they purchasing their jewellery at other markets outside the city?",Summary,"Because the research questions posed in the RAZ all relate to activity here in the previous Era, the boundaries of the RAZ follow those of RAZ 9.37 (i.e. they are a block of properties defined by Mint Lane, Mint Street, Park Street and High Street).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.37,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.37,

36e23f4f-8bb6-44b3-9f57-0defed095be6,LARA RAZ AREA,,Un-enclosed pasture west of Newland,"On the western side of the city, beyond Newland, the rich grazing land was an important resource for the citizen‰Û¡ÌÝå»s animals (Hill 1948, 334-7). The land was kept in permanent pasture, but the documentary evidence (which is mostly from the later Middle Ages) suggests that it was under pressure from over-use and from piecemeal enclosure. The larger zone of Common pasture and meadow west of the city will be of some archaeological interest because this area is now covered by ridge and furrow cultivation. This ridge and furrow needs to be dated. Several scenarios are possible and each should be tested in future work in the RAZ. The first is that the meadow was uncultivated in the High Medieval period and the ridge and furrow represents an early modern re-cultivation made prior to the Enclosure Award. On the face of it, however, this scenario is less likely than the proposal that, as the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s population grew and pressure on land rose in the 13th century, even rich meadow land such as this was taken under the plough. This would suggest that there was an expanding population within the city itself who claimed a right to lands in the common fields - and this is indeed what the few documentary references of this date may suggest. In this second scenario the land is likely to have been under the plough for only a short period, returning to common meadow by the 15th century and perhaps by the later 14th century. The ridge and furrow earthworks here, therefore, may represent very short-lived selions, which makes them very valuable in archaeological terms for our understanding of the state of cultivation technology at this date (a research agenda for cultivation of this type has been provided by Hall 1994). The lost road called Cliffgate crossed the common diagonally from south-east to north-west. This road may be detectable as an earthwork, but it is likely to survive as an undisturbed archaeological feature. Its developing relationship with the different agricultural regimes on the common should be visible and needs to be investigated with some care in sections which include not just the road surfaces but the flanking ditches and a representative area of the adjacent common land. The common is likely to have been scattered with light-weight booths for herdsmen, but unfortunately, although any such survival would be of great interest, we cannot locate them from documentary sources and it is unlikely that one will come to light except through accident. Along the northern edge of the RAZ as defined here, it is likely that there will be routeways leading towards the quarries and clay pits in the cliff face (RAZ 9.41.1), but these cannot be located at present either.",Summary,"The RAZ is defined by the city boundary to the north-west, by the 5m contour along the western and southern sides, the boundary of the old enclosures marked on the Padley map of 1819 along the east and the foot of the scarp along the north-east.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.8.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.8.2,

It is not part of the role of this document to suggest which of the many different avenues of research which could use the excavation results should be accorded the greatest priority, but it is worth noting that the discoveries of large numbers of 10th- and 11th-century graveyard monuments here have informed a series of subsequent publications (Everson and Stocker 1999; Stocker and Everson 2001; Stocker 2000 etc.). Much discussion has been aimed at setting St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s in its urban context by comparing it with other urban churches in Lincoln and within England more widely (Morris 1989). Recently it has been suggested that it may be one of that group of urban churches which owe their origins to an act of group-piety amongst a community of merchants, rather than being founded on the initiative of single lord (Stocker 2000). It is also suggested that this may mean that St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s has a similar origin to St Mary-le-Wigford, and perhaps also to some of the other city churches within market places (such as St John-the-Poor, St Peter Stanthaket and St Cuthbert). Further work on the site can only be undertaken on the outlying parts of the burial ground but, nevertheless, such work does have an important role to play. One of the greatest limitations to the value of the evidence from the St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s excavations was the lack of context for the skeletal material recovered. Although a large number of interments were excavated it is not known what percentage of the graveyard population they represent and consequently, even though the level of analysis undertaken on the excavated remains was minimal, even those results cannot be set in context until the whole population within the limits of the graveyard has been recovered. Further work is needed, therefore, on the surviving fragments of graveyard around the totally excavated church to try and set the population already excavated in some meaningful context.",Summary,"The boundaries of the graveyard have been reconstructed from documentary sources (Gilmour and Stocker 1986, fig.3a) and the RAZ follows the boundaries established there.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.25,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.25,

These programmes of repair were sometimes controversial, but they are now of great interest in the history of conservation itself. Between 1998 and 2001 the Cathedral commissioned a Conservation Plan, which summarises the academic background for every aspect of its heritage. It establishes relative importance for very conceivable aspect of the Cathedral's fittings and fabric, and points clearly to the research priorities and methodologies which should guide work here in future.

38266707-fdef-4a58-ab83-2e9b06a4eb29,LARA RAZ AREA,,The Black Monks‰Û¡ÌÝå» estate,"The agricultural regime of the cell is also of very great interest. The constant disputes between the city and monks of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s concerning rights of common on the large Monks Leas estate show that the latter were prepared to defend their investment in the land here, even though the cell itself contained few if any monks. Clearly the land was valuable, presumably as top-quality fattening meadows, and in the absence of documents, we rely on archaeological study of the agricultural buildings which must have surrounded the cell to elucidate this economy. Like St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Priory (RAZ 9.54), presumably, there would have been a substantial ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhome grange‰Û¡ÌÝå» which received large flocks of sheep for shearing at certain times of year. In the 12th and 13th centuries, one might speculate, this wool was sold by St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s to the Lincoln cloth producers, but following the collapse of the cloth trade, the wool may have been sold at the staple and shipped directly from the wharves along the Witham. The Monks' Abbey estate was, of course ideally placed to play an important part in this trade. Not only was it near the Staple Place and the wharves, but the Blackdyke and any other docks (RAZ 9.2), from where the wool would have been transported was adjacent to the Monks' south-eastern boundary. With such an advantageous location relative to Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s import-export trade, the Monks' Abbey would have been a very valuable property for St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s York. It should perhaps be comparable with the important grange of Bardney Abbey at Shortferry, eight miles down the Witham (White 1977; Stocker and Everson 2003), where important collections of later medieval pottery demonstrate the importance of this site as a transhipment point for landing goods arriving from the coast. Similar large and distinctive collections of pottery should be looked for in the vicinity of Monks' Abbey. It is also likely that the Monks' Abbey will have capitalised on the various springs of water which rose along the foot of the cliff within their estate. One of these was used by the Blackfriars in 1260 (RAZ 9.53.2), another was used to supply the city in the 1530s (Stocker 1990). The remains of such conduits and intake houses should be searched for in future work in the RAZ. Some of these springs would have been suitable sources of water to drive mills, although no such mills seem to have been recorded.Any putative early estate centre, presumably focused on the area surrounding the later cell, would have been in a very similar location to the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s estate centre at Willingthorpe in Newland and they may have been quite similar institutions. Comparisons between the domestic and agricultural arrangements in both estate centres would be highly instructive; the Benedictines made the Black Monks an important source of income, and fought to keep it distinct from the city to the west, whereas the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s estate seems to have become engulfed within the city, and did not keep its separate identity. These different trajectories probably have their origin in the different agricultural and commercial uses to which the estate centres were put, and those differences should be visible archaeologically.In addition to these well-framed aspects of archaeological importance, there is a group of more intangible questions surrounding Monks' Abbey. Ever since Leland recorded that he had heard that this was the site of St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 7th-century monastery known as Icanhoe (Toulmin Smith ed. 1964, I, 30), rumours have existed that this was an early church site. Furthermore, we have already seen that the estate in which it sits might be the successor to a major Roman estate based on the Greetwell Villa (RAZ 7.23) and it is occasionally proposed that early monastic sites are the direct descendants of Roman estates. The Monks' Abbey sits at the northern end of the Stamp End causeway, which is one of a group of such causeways across the Witham, which frequently do have early church sites adjace",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn to include the whole of the area of the Monks Leas estate including RAZ 9.55.1. This is because, although it is known that the great majority of the area was always grazing land, any part of the estate may contain key evidence for the monastic economy in the form of structures such as mills and other agricultural installations or features such as rubbish disposal. It includes the stretch of river frontage along the Witham in RAZ 9.2, which has been also characterised as part of the commercial port. This is because both the interrelationship between the monastery and the port-side features, and the monastic background to any facilities discovered here should be born in mind during future research.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.55.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.55.2,

Virtually nothing is known of the suburb beyond what can be gleaned from the few surviving property deeds, but these show clearly that the settlement disappeared almost as quickly as it had arisen. We need to understand more of the timing and character of this desertion. Was this suburb always marginal and, therefore, inevitably an early casualty of the economic collapse? Or did its direct connection with Staple Place ensure that it survived into the late medieval period? Speed‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map shows no buildings at all south of Thornbridge (although the bridge itself is shown) and this confirms the picture gathered from the documents that the suburb was entirely depopulated from the 14th to the 16th century. Presumably the survival of the bridge indicates that there was some passage across the river, perhaps for beasts on their way to the South Common grazing. By the 18th century, however, some building work had taken place along what was, presumably, the newly created street and quayside known as Waterside South, and old photographs show buildings of the late 17th or early 18th century here.",Summary,The boundaries of the RAZ are entirely notional.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.3,

This potential transformation is interesting because most Lincoln churches with declining populations managed to hang on to their parochial status and we might ask what was different about St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s in the late Middle Ages which facilitated this demotion. The church was evidently in a poor state of repair by the Reformation and the tiles were sold by the City Council in 1535 (HMC 1895, 34; Stocker 1990) prior to its demolition.",Summary,"We know that the graveyard was bounded to the east by St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane but, because it was said to be large, the RAZ boundaries are drawn to include a strip running from Langworthgate to Greetwellgate.

There is no indication of an exceptionally early date, although we need to know how its establishment related to the laying out of streets and domestic buildings in this part of the city. The earliest such buildings excavated on Flaxengate date from the start of the 10th century. However, they were probably within the area which subsequently became the parish of St Lawrence. The parish of St George perhaps belongs to the period following the establishment of the grid pattern, identified by Dr Vince, of streets in the lower city (chapter 9a; RAZ 9.25) and this might suggest a somewhat later date for its foundation. As it is not a church associated with a market we might speculate that it was a lordly foundation made to cater for the population of a small urban holding. The population of this holding was probably never large and by 1428 it had fewer than 10 inhabitants. Such simple churches can often be as revealing about medieval piety as the much grander buildings and the way in which ritual was managed within a limited space is of great interest.The churchyard population is also likely to be of interest, also, as it will represent a more marginal group, presumably dominated by the lower orders of society, and will provide valuable evidence for the types of people who lived in settlements such as Flaxengate. As a group it will also provide an interesting contrast with the more wealthy population of a parish such as St Lawrence (RAZ 9.60.39) or St Martin (RAZ 9.60.38).",Summary,"The site of the churchyard is known. It was bounded by Grantham Street to the south and Danes Terrace to the east. To the west it was probably originally set out along the original Flaxengate frontage (well to the west of the modern street line), but this street frontage may have been encroached on, and the church closed off from the street at an early date. This also means that the original churchyard is likely to extend below the modern street of Flaxengate and works here should be subject to archaeological investigation. The northern boundary is uncertain and an arbitrary line has been chosen.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.40,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.40,

The medieval circuit of walls and gates (RAZ 9.50.2 & 10.50.2) were still sufficiently intact for the Close to be sealed off in times of civil insurrection, as for example during the riots over the Dean and Chapter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s decision to demolish the cathedral western spires in 1724 (Hill 1966, 38-41). However, as the 18th century wore on, concern that the Close be defended from the city declined; both of the Close gates on Eastgate were demolished early in the 19th century and the western Exchequergate was demolished c.1800. In 1815-16 the gate at the north end of Pottergate, known as Priorygate, was demolished, but it is significant that an archway was built in its place to ensure that the all-important boundary between the Close and the Bail was still demarcated. The replacement arch has no military features and has no provision for hanging gates. This rather unusual structure is a potent symbol of the distinctiveness of the Close and it is probably built from re-used stone, derived from the former gatehouse, which should be investigated during repair work. Industrial Era repairs to the wall are interesting then, as evidence that the Dean and Chapter still thought the boundary worth marking even if not defending.",Summary,The RAZ includes the wall and the line of the wall with a 10m wide strip on either side to include buried features.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.8,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.8,

3a669955-f8d5-4279-a722-0a71472d07b2,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Katherine's Priory and St Sepulchre‰Û¡ÌÝå»s hospital,"Situated just to the west of the green outside Great Bargate, St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Priory was much the largest and most important of the Lincoln monasteries and it has many distinctive features of interest in monastic studies. The origin of the Priory as a Gilbertine House of Lay Sisters and Canons who were given the specific responsibility of caring for the inmates of an important city hospital is unusual. The hospital of St Sepulchre had been founded in the episcopate of Robert Bloet (1094-1123) at least a generation earlier, but, for reasons which are likely to be very interesting, it was thought best to hand the infant institution over c.1148 to a new monastery founded by Bishop de Chesney expressly to look after it . Part of the reason for this apparent change in the character of the hospital might lie in the foundation directly opposite it, on the other side of the green, of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáMalandry‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Holy Innocent‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hospital - RAZ 9.56). It is possible that the conversion of the original hospital and the foundation of the two new institutions at Malandry and St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s represent steps in a co-ordinated effort to make a charitable and religious point at the southern entrance to the city. All three institutions were founded by the bishops themselves. Although there is some confusion over which bishops founded which hospitals, it is clear by the later Middle Ages that the three bodies were providing three different kinds of service. The Malandry was an important leper hospital, whilst to judge from late medieval bequests, St Sepulchre‰Û¡ÌÝå»s seems to have developed a particular specialism in the care of orphaned and sick children (see e.g. ed. Foster 1914, 212 for index of at least 37 bequests to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápupils and orphans of St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s‰Û¡ÌÝå» in citizens‰Û¡ÌÝå» wills written between 1271 and 1526). This agglomeration of charitable institutions is of interest as a group and, although work needs to be done on all of them individually, results should be compared with results from adjacent sites. It is clear that the monastery at St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s was adjacent to, but distinct from, the hospital itself - i.e. the two closes seem to have remained distinct (Cole 1903-4), This is also somewhat unusual and it shows that the hospital was considered to be an important institution in its own right. Future investigations within the RAZ should explore this purposely constructed division between hospital and monastery to establish what level of communication was permitted by the two institutions. The hospital buildings may have consisted largely of a great infirmary hall, and information about this hall would be welcome, but we know much less about the lesser buildings which surrounded these great hospitals and information about them would be of even greater interest. A research agenda for institutions of this type was set by Gilchrist (1985).South of the hospital the large monastery itself, being a member of the Gilbertine order, is of great interest. Although it was a much larger and more important institution, it compares in many interesting ways with the recently excavated Gilbertine Priory of St Andrew outside the walls of York (Kemp and Graves 1996). Both houses were founded by senior ecclesiastical figures alongside major market places adjacent to one of the principal gateways of the town.

The present fabric is merely the eastern part of the medieval church (the choir and adjacent chapel), but the tower (of 17th-century date) is built re-using masonry from the demolished nave (Stocker 1982). Fabric works to the church, but especially to the tower, need to be carefully monitored. The church is in a key location for the understanding of the development of the Wigford suburb and its foundation date needs to be tied down as precisely as possible. It appears to be a relatively late foundation, being built, one presumes, to cater for a new population housed on the newly reclaimed land at the northern end of the Roman causeway (or at least this is the interpretation placed on the sequences of waterfront development and dumping in excavations at SB85). There is some evidence to suggest that some of the key merchants in 12th-14th century Lincoln had residences in this parish and the presence of such a relatively wealthy population may be detectable in the graveyard population. It may also be reflected not just in the quality of the surviving early 13th-century work in the standing fabric, but also in the elaborate new east window provided in the second quarter of the 14th century, after the collapse of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s cloth industry. Certainly in the late-14th century Clerical Poll taxes, St Benedict‰Û¡ÌÝå»s had the largest population of chantry priests and clerks in Wigford, if not in the city (with a staff of 12 or 13 priests in 1377) (McHardy 1992).",Summary,"The boundaries of the medieval churchyard are known and include a slightly larger area than those now maintained as a public open space.

The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In all four, of course, the churches and other claustral buildings will be of interest and plans need to be recovered, but we know a great deal about fraternal plans (e.g. Butler 1984) and attention should now be turning to more complex aspects of the archaeology of friaries. One of the new avenues requiring exploration is the study of burial populations at friaries; cemeteries will be of interest as valuable resources for paleo-pathology, but although we have a certain level of documentation about burials in the Lincoln friaries, we badly need a fully excavated graveyard to provide a proper sample. Some burials have been excavated under the Carmelite Friary, but it is not clear what percentage of the total they represent. These types of studies may be best targeted at the Austin Friary in Newport, which seems to be almost completely undisturbed. Consequently, any development proposals here should be accompanied by provision for the archaeological excavation of the complete church and burial ground. A similar opportunity may also exist at the Blackfriars, although the many reports of burials found here over the years suggest that this burial population may have been compromised already.By comparison with the other three major fraternal orders, the Lincoln Augustinian Friary in Newport is little known. Perhaps this is because its site has been the least compromised by subsequent development and it may, therefore, offer the most intact archaeological sequence. Furthermore one of the present buildings on the site (23 Newport) is of some antiquity and reuses medieval masonry in some of its walls. Development work on this important building should be undertaken under archaeological supervision, as even if it does not retain in situ friary fabric, the masonry of which it is built will be of interest in its own right. Beneath its fraternal archaeology the friary site will preserve important archaeology relating to the early development of the suburb of Newport (RAZ 9.26), the importance of which is enhanced by the fact that it has a known terminus ante quem of c.1270.",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to follow and include the presumed precinct boundary, extracted from early mapping (Padley 1819).

Obviously, the wall continued standing through the Early Modern Era and at times it was used as a defended enceint (for example during the Civil War, or during the attacks on the Close during the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536 (Ward 1996) or the so-called ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáspires riot‰Û¡ÌÝå» in 1726 (Hill 1954). We should expect, then, many interesting alterations and adaptations to the Wall in the Early Modern Era intended to keep it viable and, as in the Civil War perhaps, to bring it up to date with contemporary military thinking. In practice, however, there is relatively little evidence in the standing fabric for later alterations and additions. The archway over the carriageway leading eastwards out of the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace (a replacement of an original Close Wall gate tower) dates from the episcopate of Bishop Smith (1495-1514) (Jones et al. 1990, 66). Archaeological investigation here should be aimed at understanding the factors surrounding this replacement, which are currently obscure. We know nothing of other alterations made to the wall and its gatehouses following its initial construction, but all of the gates are likely to preserve in their fabric or buried deposits rare evidence for emergency blocking during times of documented (or undocumented) civil emergency. These remains will be fugitive but of considerable interest if detected.",Summary,The RAZ follows the same boundaries at RAZ 9.50.2.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.50.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.50.2,

3d6bf2c0-2ee8-4f48-8370-faa756582a59,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Cow Paddle Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌCow Paddle Character Area is a long and fairly narrow area of land on the east of the City that for the most part is bounded to the north by an active railway line and to the south by Washingborough Road. Transport infrastructure, both active and disused, is a key feature influencing the character of the area, defining its boundaries and separating it from the rest of the City. Land uses in the Character Area are typical of the urban fringe, with many requiring the uptake of large areas of land.The Character Area is divided into several sites arranged broadly parallel to Washingborough Road and the majority of these have their own specific function. With the exception of Cow Paddle which is common land, these functions are typical of an edge-of-town area and include three cemeteries, a crematorium, a permanent traveller settlement, a golf range and bowling centre, and a sewage treatment works. The latter also extends to the south of Washingborough Road, adjacent to an area known as Canwick Pastures, which is an extension of Canwick Golf Course. The main uses in the Character Area are recreation, burial and cremation, and sewage treatment.The Character Area is situated on the southern side of the Witham valley, as the river heads eastwards out of the City. The low-lying area was frequently waterlogged and subject to flooding. Wetland bordering the River Witham during the Roman and Early Medieval Era [410-850 AD] was probably an important resource for wildfowling, fishing and the collecting of fuel and thatching materials. By the High Medieval Era [850-1350 AD] land in the Character Area was part of a large open common that would have been meadows or open grassland used for the grazing of livestock. Up until the Early Industrial Period [1750-1845 AD], land within the Character Area continued to be grazed and cultivated in common by residents of Canwick. In 1787, the majority of common land around the village was enclosed by Act of Parliament. After enclosure, Cow Paddle in the west of the Character Area remained part of South Common (previously known as Canwick Common), but was cut off by the construction of Canwick Road in 1843. Construction of communication infrastructure in the Post-Railway Expansion [1849-1966 AD] and Late Victorian/Edwardian [1868-1919] Periods marginalised the Character Area from the south of the city. As a result, land use in the area quickly became typical of that often associated with an urban fringe.Sites in the Character Area are divided by a variety of boundaries, ranging from different types of agricultural boundaries to more formal definitions enclosing the cemeteries.The section of Cow Paddle north of the railway line appears to have been unmanaged for many years. The southern part is an area of grassland containing short-mown areas that are marked out as football pitches, areas of coarse grassland and areas that are of greater variety botanically as a result of grazing by rabbits. The cemeteries all contain mown grassland between the graves and planted specimen trees. Buildings in the Character Area date from the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period onwards and vary considerably in scale and form depending on their function. The Character Area contains a number of large-scale buildings associated with industrial works and recreational faculties, and a number of religious buildings within the cemeteries.From many places in the Character Area, there are views up to the Cathedral on the north escarpment. This is a wide view incorporating not just the Cathedral but also the trees that surround it, the buildings on the hillside and parts of the lower City. In several places there are views that extend beyond the railway, towards an industrial area north of the river. To the east, there are views of the various structures used by the sewage treatment works. To the west, there are views towards South Common but these are only available from the western part of the Character Area, as further east long views are obscured by the gradual incline of the escarpment within Canwick Golf Course.Despite being relatively close to the City Centre, the Character Area is very separate from the built-up parts of the City. This is due to the roads and railways that divide the Character Area from neighbouring areas. Access from the north is very limited due to the railway line, and the main access points are all off Washingborough Road.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 85,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,71,

3d7e64aa-ba74-4b6b-9cc1-5fdac00ad029,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Bailgate and Castle Hill Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Bailgate and Castle Hill Character Area (see Figure 1) is located on largely flat land on the top of the north escarpment overlooking the Witham ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágap‰Û¡ÌÝå». It has a complex townscape character that has been strongly influenced by nearly 2000 years of historical development, notably during the Roman and High Medieval Eras. This influence is most noticeable in the street layout and building plots as well as surviving buildings. The irregular grid street pattern is largely medieval and the mainly deep building plots running back from the streets with narrow frontages are strongly influenced by surviving medieval burgage plots. Bailgate, Castle Hill and Steep Hill and the medieval burgage plots form the heart of the Character Area. The townscape character is also very strongly influenced by the nearby ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáiconic‰Û¡ÌÝå» medieval buildings of the Cathedral and Castle Cathedral and Castle, especially in Castle Hill. The Cathedral and Castle, together with the historic monuments within the Character Area (Newport Arch, the Mint Wall, the Roman well and the outline at the former St Peter in the Bail site), form an important part of the influence of earlier developments on the current townscape character. This Character Area, together with the neighbouring Cathedral and Castle Character Areas, is a key tourist destination in Lincoln and the East Midlands region. Castle Hill is a key public square and nodal point for pedestrian movement. Around Castle Hill the buildings are taller than most of the rest of the Character Area, often three to four storeys high, and provide a good sense of enclosure to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásquare‰Û¡ÌÝå». However, the sense of enclosure is degraded by the surface car park on a lower level to the west, even with the Castle to its rear. The existing natural materials used in the public realm, including stone slabs on the footways and stone setts in the carriageway, are important townscape elements, in particular on Steep Hill, Exchequergate and Castle Hill.Bailgate and Steep Hill act as a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáHigh Street‰Û¡ÌÝå» in the area with a mix of residential and commercial uses continuing a long tradition of these uses since the medieval era. 18th and 19th century houses and shops on former medieval plots along Bailgate and Steep Hill form a key part of the townscape. The form, materials and architectural style of the buildings in Bailgate and Castle Hill vary greatly which reflects the complex history of development in the area, mainly carried out plot by plot. The buildings provide no clear rhythm along the streets due to their varied form and door/window patterns. The building density is high and there is a good sense of enclosure along relatively narrow streets with mainly two to three storey buildings set at the back of the footway. The very narrow Steep Hill gives a particularly strong sense of enclosure which provides a striking contrast at its junction with the wider space of Castle Hill. The northern end of Bailgate opens out to create a wider space with raised footways on either side. Along Bailgate and Steep Hill, in particular, there are varied roofscapes which can be seen from the streets, including many steep roofs, and which reflect the varied form and periods of the buildings fronting onto the streets.The medieval buildings in this and neighbouring Character Areas are part of a nationally recognised group of residential and commercial medieval buildings.There are some small urban blocks which allow easy movement within parts of the Character Area. However, surrounding large, irregularly shaped urban blocks to the SW, SE, NW and NE, principally influenced by the earlier walls of the upper city, inhibit movement in these directions. Vehicle traffic through much of the area is restricted.There are many landmark buildings in a relatively small area, including Newport Arch, Leigh Pemberton House, the Cathedral and Castle, Exchequergate, the Prince of Wales public house. They often terminate views along streets. The views along the historic streetscapes and of the Cathedral and Castle also contribute greatly to the townscape character.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 91,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,26,

3d97932d-83ce-4e27-b3f6-271cd4ef972f,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing areas,"Mr Jones has outlined the evidence for domestic structures in Lindum (chapter 7a), and has shown that there are differences in quality between the major stone- or partly stone-built houses within the walls and the mostly timber framed buildings, until the late 3rd century, within the various suburbs. These differences, as well as more minor differences between structures within both groups, were no doubt brought about by differing social and economic roles. We will need to gather much more information before we are able to discuss Lindum‰Û¡ÌÝå»s internal economy, but collections of plan and artefact information will help in this process. So far we have little evidence for the location of markets in the Roman town. The best evidence is probably provided by the presumed measuring device at SM76, which suggests that at least one market was located outside the walled town close to the edge of the river, perhaps to facilitate the movement of goods. Markets are not always easy to detect in small-scale excavations, but certain types of artefact studies (for example of the types of coins lost - the proportion of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásmall-change‰Û¡ÌÝå» compared with finds of gold and silver) can suggest their presence and must be looked for. The fact that little evidence for markets has yet been forthcoming might be due to lack of investigation, or it might suggest that we are pursuing an inappropriate economic model for the Roman city. A city full of separate markets would imply that Lindum was a great entrepot, with a large ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáinternal‰Û¡ÌÝå» population, but we are starting to appreciate, at cities like Colchester, that the internal population in British towns of the 3rd and 4th centuries was not that large. Some archaeologists now prefer to see the town more as the focal point for administration in its region; the place where the local land-owners came to fulfil the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» responsibilities which went hand in hand with their authority on their country estates (Millett 1990, chap. 6; Esmond Cleary 1993, 7). Towns like Lindum, therefore, may not have had a permanently resident population sufficiently large to act as a natural magnet for goods and services. It may be the case that any markets held here came about because market traders were compelled in various ways to attend markets in or around the city, under the supervision of the Imperial authorities, rather than as an expression of spontaneous economic activity. The appreciation that the city may not have been as full of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» properties as was once thought makes the detailed study of those buildings that are already known even more important. The major houses of Lindum, indicated by the 4th-century mosaics and similar embellishments, may not have been permanent family residences, but rather the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátown-houses‰Û¡ÌÝå» of the provincial elite, who used them only when playing their ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» role within provincial administration, but who actually lived in villas in the countryside. No doubt these ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátown houses‰Û¡ÌÝå» develop and change from use to use, so some will have changed from a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» use to a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» one during the Colonia Era, and the chronology of these changes will document the development of administration and economy of the local region. Of particular importance is the possible change in the character of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s housing, highlighted by Mr Jones, which may have come about as a direct result of the effective re-foundation of the city in the 4th century as the provincial capital. This will certainly have meant the arrival of larger numbers of members of the governing elite in the city, and they will have required large houses fit for their status. Some of these houses will have been more ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» than ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» (see RAZ 7.11.1, 7.11.4, 7.22), but many will also have contained retreats for the high-status family even though they may have contained one or two ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» rooms. Such large houses are known or presumed in both lower and upper cities, usually on the basis of discoveries of mosaics.

3d9d3a58-c6a9-483f-b0c3-0fe4a64bbdf3,LARA RAZ AREA,,Carmelite Friary,"The four friaries of the major orders (Augustinian, Carmelite, Dominican and Franciscan) in Lincoln represent a good group nationally, and in addition, Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s exceptionally rare example of the Friary of the Sack (extinct by 1307) continued in religious use in the early part of the Early Modern Era. The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In the course of the final two centuries of their existence we should be interested in adaptations to the churches and other claustral buildings which may cast light on the changing attitudes of the orders to their rules and to their relationship with the secular world. In the post-Dissolution period these sites retain considerable interest. Their archaeology should cast light on the attitudes of the new secular owners to the old religion; was it deliberately denigrated or were its monuments treated with dignity and respect? In the case of the Carmelite Friary and St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Conduit we may have rare evidence for the latter attitude. In all of these cases we must be aware that the fraternal buildings are likely to have converted for secular uses at the Dissolution. Little is known about these conversions in Lincoln or elsewhere and the chance should be taken to study this important aspect of early modern archaeology as well as the archaeology of these Friaries themselves.The important Lincoln house of the Carmelites has little documentary history, but the site has been the subject of major excavations (Z86, ZWB94, ZEA95, ZEB95), although the results have yet to be published. The results show, nevertheless, that there was considerable rebuilding in the precinct in the late Middle Ages, with the church, amongst other buildings, being substantially altered. The Kyme chapel, however, the one structure whose appearance can be partially reconstructed from architectural fragments reused in St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Conduit (Stocker 1990), has yet to be located. Further work on the site, perhaps only in post-excavation, should concentrate on elucidating these late medieval developments. What was it about the Lincoln Carmelites that enabled them to rebuild on such a comprehensive scale? As a partially waterlogged precinct, attention should be paid to the western part of the site, where important evidence for the standard of living at the friary is likely to be preserved. Is any increase in wealth or luxury here detectable in these assemblages? We have already mentioned in RAZ 9.53.3 that the manner in which the Friars dealt with their commercial street front, along High Street, is of great interest and this is as true in the late medieval era as at earlier times. We need to understand whether they sought to capitalise on this valuable land as a regular monastery would have done, or whether, in line with their vows, they took no part in the commerce of Wigford to the east of their boundary wall. In this context the letting to a secular of a chamber within the precinct near Le Garners in 1520 is of particular interest (ed. Page 1906, 225). The excavations showed that after the Dissolution many changes were made in the conventual buildings. These changes need to be the subject of greater study to understand what type of property was being created by the new secular landlord. Was this a single great house to be let to a member of the County gentry or was it a more humble group of commercially profitable tenements for citizens? The answer to this question may be of importance for the character of 16th-century Lincoln as a whole. In London, for example the pressure of population on space was so great that former monastic precincts rapidly became warrens of houses and tenements for the resident population. In declining Lincoln however, it is likely that such pressures did not exist and therefore the intermittent (rented) occupation of such large properties by the County gentry may have been a more profitable use for the new landlord.It has be",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the whole precinct of the Friary at its fullest extent, the site of which has been deduced from documents (Gilmour and Stocker 1986, fig 3).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.53.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.53.3,

Bracebridge pasture first recorded 1538 - Cameron 1985, 193). Comparisons between this area and the city common meadow (RAZs 9.8.1-5) may be instructive. It may be that the strip of land along the foot of the cliff and east of the village and road to Brant Broughton was more readily turned to cultivation, but any such cultivation would have to be enclosed as it is likely that access would be required across this land by animals passing from the waterside meadows to the grassland on the cliff edge and vice-versa.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the 5m contour marking the eastern limit of the waterlogged ground and by the break in slope at the foot of the scarp, where the modern city boundary runs on the west.

As in the High Medieval Era (RAZ 9.55.1, 9.55.2), the last 200 years of the cell‰Û¡ÌÝå»s existence represent archaeology of some rarity. Not only do few such cells have standing buildings like those at Monks' Abbey, which permit us to understand the round of services maintained here by the small colony of monks, but the late medieval documentary history of the site indicates an institution of changing character, sometimes more of an estate centre, at others more of a monastery. The fabric of the ruins is, then, of great sensitivity and importance and all works here must be accompanied by an archaeological recording programme. Elevation drawings and other records in Padley 1851 are valuable, but modern elevations should be produced as circumstances permit. Future research questions on the site should be directed towards understanding not only the plan of structures here, but also the very distinctive religious life which must have taken place in the later Middle Ages. Was a round of daily service maintained, within the formal setting of a cloister, or was this rather a house more like a monastic farm, where the commercial activities of the agricultural estate took precedence over the rule? Even though the house had no monks at all in residence at certain stages, documentation in the 1530s, just prior to the Dissolution, shows that St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s York were still very reluctant to let the site go - it was too valuable an estate. The periods when the church was not used for the monastic routine should show in the archaeology of the church itself and in its relationship to the cell buildings around about.The agricultural regime of the late medieval cell is also of very great interest. The constant disputes between the city and monks of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s over rights of common on the large Monks Leas estate show that the latter were prepared to defend their investment in the land here, even though the cell itself contained few if any monks. Clearly the land was valuable, presumably as top-quality fattening meadows and in the absence of documents, we rely on archaeological study of the agricultural buildings which must have surrounded the cell to elucidate this economy. Like St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, presumably, there would have been a substantial ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhome grange‰Û¡ÌÝå» which received large flocks of sheep for shearing at certain times of year. Following the collapse of the cloth trade, the wool may have been sold at the staple and shipped directly from the wharves along the Witham. The Monks' Abbey was, of course, ideally placed to play an important part in this trade. Not only was it near the Staple Place and the wharves, but the Blackdyke and any other docks (RAZ 9.2), from where the wool would have sailed was adjacent to the Monks' south-eastern boundary. With such an advantageous location relative to Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s import-export trade, the Monks' Abbey would have been a very valuable property for St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s York. It should perhaps be comparable with the important grange of Bardney Abbey at Shortferry, 8 miles down the Witham (White 1977; Stocker and Everson 2003), where important collections of later medieval pottery demonstrate how important the site was as a transhipment point for landing goods coming in from the coast. Similar large and distinctive collections of pottery should be looked for in the vicinity of Monks' Abbey. It is also likely that the Monks' Abbey will have capitalised on the various springs of water that rose along the foot of the cliff within their estate. Some of these would have been suitable sources of water to drive mills, although no such mills seem to have been recorded.The City Council themselves were interested in obtaining a grant of the cell at the Dissolution (HMC 1895, 34-5), but the site passed rapidly into the occupation of, first, the Deyncot family, then to the Sapcote family (by 1548?) an",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn to include the whole of the area of the Monks Leas estate. This is because, although it is known that the great majority of the area was always grazing land, any part of the estate may contain key evidence for the monastic economy in the form of structures such as mills and other agricultural installations or features such as rubbish disposal. It includes the stretch of river frontage along the Witham in RAZ 9.2, which has been also characterised as part of the commercial port.

The structure is technically interesting and full records should be made during repair and alteration. It also has an importance as a Lincoln civil engineering product doing service in Lincoln. Its location is a reminder that by 1878 the north bank of the Witham, along Monks Road, was starting to be developed for housing for workers at the iron works on the south side.

3e1fb7d2-3aab-42d2-8689-29af6d875127,LARA RAZ AREA,,Springs and pools on the hillside,"In the pre-Roman period, natural springs emerged at several points along the cliff-face at the junction between the limestone and the clay and formed small streams which flowed down the slope (RAZ 5.4, 6.13). This spring water gathered in pools near the foot of the cliff, but above the river, such as that partly excavated at Silver Street and that represented by the medieval Crackpool. We have suggested that both the springs themselves, and the pools which they formed, might have been regarded as sacred sites in the pre-Roman Iron Age and in the early Romano-British period, although the only concrete evidence for this comes from the excavations at SPM83, where an intact amphora had been buried in a pit adjacent to the spring which emerges near the junction between Spring Hill and Michaelgate (RAZ 5.4, 6.13). These springs were mobile to some extent, and this RAZ forms a zone where any indications of ritual activity should be tested for and investigated carefully. The Spring Hill/Michaelgate spring may be typical of many, however, in that it seems to have changed function in the late Roman period, when the site went from being a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» space to use as a large ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» house. The ritual potency of the site itself may have been lost in the later Roman period, but it is quite possible that the water itself was ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátamed‰Û¡ÌÝå» and may have been led to the great fountain in the centre of the temple complex just inside the south gate of the lower city. If the water from this zone of springs was channelled down the hill towards the temple complex at the foot of the hill in the later Roman period (RAZ 7.20), the seat of power of their patronal gods would have been transferred along with them. The ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápower‰Û¡ÌÝå» would have thereby been drained from a natural spring site into a man-made spring within the temple complex - which was, no doubt, under the control of a professional priestly class. The ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» ritual space on the hillside had been appropriated as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» space by the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s elite, whilst the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» ritual itself had been regimented and constrained, within a dedicated site, to serve civic ends (see RAZ 7.20 below).",Summary,"It is not easy to define a useful RAZ for these presumed features on the strength of archaeological assessment, as few archaeological finds have been made.

The new building dated from 1781 and was a small aisle-less box with minimal neo-classical detailing and is known through a single Grimm view made in the mid 1780s (Hill 1966, plate 6a). This building will be detectable in excavations and its plan, and the remains of fittings, will be of great interest as evidence for the doctrinal standpoint of the church in the city at the start of the period of rising population and wealth which characterised the Industrial Era. We should also be able to tell whether parts of the old fabric were reused in the new building. It should be compared directly with the churches of St Mark and St Paul, which were rebuilt at a similar date (RAZ 11.91.5 & 11.91.8). St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s appears to have been larger and more expertly detailed than the others. This church did not survive long, however, and it was completely rebuilt in 1870 (to the designs of A. Blomfield) and a new south aisle was added in 1914 (to designs by Temple Moore). These enlargements, and the comprehensive re-fitting of the chancel to designs by Bodley in 1884, all point towards a prosperous and expanding church community. The churchyard, which still survives, will contain interments of this Era, which are particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered a deterioration in their circumstances. Along with other graveyards in the city, the churchyard was closed in the early 1850s and burials were moved to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoverspill‰Û¡ÌÝå» graveyard on open ground to the north-east. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city.

This is because the decision was made in 1727 to resume occupation on the site. The first Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s house here since the medieval period was a small affair, not much more than an over-night lodge. But this limited function means that its remains (in the south and west part of the palace courtyard) represent a building of some interest, although it is not easy to understand its form as it was subsumed by the Victorian palace. One target for future research here, therefore, ought to be the elucidation of the plan of the building of 1727 and an explanation of its function. In 1886 this house was comprehensively rebuilt and enlarged by the notable church architect Ewan Christian. The resulting building is one of the most important bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s palaces of the Victorian Era and the building deserves to be treated as such when conservation is envisaged. The layout and detailing of the new palace illustrate the aspirations of the 19th-century episcopate, whilst the architectural details employed contain many references to the concepts on which their rule was based. In particular the re-occupation of the service end of the old hall as the chapel (an ingenious conversion by Bodley and Garner in 1888) is notable. Not only are the remains of the original medieval fabric here of interest, but the manner of its conversion is also highly informative. We are also fortunate that a Conservation Plan has been completed for the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace site and, consequently, there is no need to repeat the Research Agenda laid out there (Coppack 1999).",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the 12th-century boundaries of the Palace, which are all established through documentary and archaeological means.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.33,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.33,

3f395d39-6ca3-4806-8a9c-698f0ed14615,LARA RAZ AREA,,Boultham,"Boultham is almost unknown archaeologically. Yet, having been under Victorian parkland it is likely that the village‰Û¡ÌÝå»s settlement archaeology survives particularly well. A research agenda for this topic is currently in production as part of the East Midlands Research Agenda process (Everson 2000; Courtney 2001), but settlement in the area has been characterised by Robert and Wrathmell (2000) and their characterisation raises several of the key questions. In common with many in the sub-province called Central Lincolnshire Nscarps and Clay-vale (CLNSC) the settlement pattern is likely to be based on a manorial curia, the location of which is unknown, although it may be somewhere near the church. Many village tofts have been excavated in Lincolnshire and in the East Midlands more widely, but nevertheless, further information is almost always valuable. In the case of Boultham exploration of the tofts should focus on particular characteristics which might be distinctive here, both on account of the settlement‰Û¡ÌÝå»s local topography and on account of its proximity to the city. The poor soils in the parish, commented on by Arthur Young in 1771 (Hill 1966, 113), were no doubt partly responsible for the small scale of settlement here, but it is not likely that the managed woodlands which occupied most of the parish were unproductive - on the contrary the woodlands were a valuable economic resource. There must have been a considerable trade in the provision of wood, probably coppiced, and perhaps also peat from the fringes of the Swanpool to the north, for use in the city. This woodland character of the parish connects it with the large areas of wood which are known to have existed in parishes on similar geologies to the south-west and west (Darby 1952, 91-2; Cole 1897-8, 382 etc.). These areas are known to have been used for pannage in Swinderby (Darby 1952, 57-8) and this may have been an important activity in Boultham also. Any such unusual aspects of Boultham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s agricultural economy should be comprehensible in the village RAZ in the numbers and forms of buildings in the tofts, compared with those in settlements like Bracebridge. Indeed, as part of the village site lies in 19th-century parkland it is likely that a preliminary earthwork survey will provide important information about the layout of the village buildings relative to other structures. But these aspects of Boultham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s history might also be explored even more cost-effectively through extensive environmental sampling - especially on the edges of the wetland. Distinctive aspects of Boultham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s settlement archaeology may be due to the proximity of the market for fire-wood, constructional timber, peat or pork in the city, but we will learn a great deal, also, from comparison with the equivalent settlement at Bracebridge. Although only 1 km away, Bracebridge is a quite different type of settlement in terms of its agricultural hinterland and economy, but we think that it too may have specialised, in order to supply the city with certain staples (RAZs 9.8.3 & 9.10). Presumably there is a symbiotic relationship here; Boultham and Bracebridge could provide different raw materials and may have specialised in order not to compete with each other.The RAZ includes the site and surviving structure of the parish church of St Helen. This building was extensively rebuilt in 1864 and 1887, but it retains some earlier architectural details reused in later fabric. All works in and around the church should be subject to detailed archaeological recording in order that the structural history of the church can be elucidated. In this case we should be interested in what size of church a modest settlement the size of Boultham could sustain. It is likely to have been founded in the 10th or 11th centuries, along with the churches in many of Lincolnshire‰Û¡ÌÝå»s nucleated settlements, but this needs to be established. The dedication is an ancient one, however, and it is possible that the church was e",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the known area of tofts and crofts, including also, presumably, the manorial curia, as well as an extension southwards, into Boultham Park to include the dam which forms the lake on the Pike Drain, which may preserve the remains of earlier road crossings towards the village,",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.11,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.11,

3fb34eab-7963-45fa-a9a0-50589bfc1ba4,LARA RAZ AREA,,High Bridge and ford,"The High Bridge at Lincoln is a structure of great interest and importance in its own right. A recent study has identified at least five phases of construction in the present building (Hall et al. 1984), the earliest dating to 1160, and because the bridge is the very pivot around which the city turns, the understanding of its complexity will tell us a great deal about the sequence of development in the city as a whole (RAZ 9.15) . All works, both to the tenements on the western side and to the fabric below road level must be carefully monitored and recorded. The road surface itself also requires archaeological attention when repair or enhancement work is undertaken - not just because earlier road surfaces themselves may be of interest but because it is likely that information about the bridge chapel of St Thomas will be preserved below the pavement on the eastern side. Before the Reformation, St Thomas‰Û¡ÌÝå» had acquired two important chantries, one in support of the Mayor and Corporation (Venables 1887-8, 334-5) and these should have left some impact on the liturgical layout of the chapel in the late middle ages which might be detectable archaeologically. St Thomas' is an interesting structure which was converted into a dwelling house in 1549 (HMC 1895, 42) and the practicalities of this conversion will be of considerable archaeological interest. We should be interested in why this chapel was considered to be appropriate for re-use as a building in a manner which does not seem to have been common in Lincoln. The second phase of the bridge structure demonstrates that the bridge was built alongside a paved ford. This ford is also of very great importance and we need to understand periods during which it was maintained or enhanced. The fact that, under the terms of a lease of the chapel building in 1561 (HMC 1895, 53), it was specifically stated that ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáthe arches are not to be hurt‰Û¡ÌÝå» suggests that the ford was still open to north and south at that date. -High Bridge is also famous for the timber-framed buildings which line its western side. Although much restored, they are rare survivals of bridge shops in England, a type of building which is known from documentary sources to have been widespread. They are said to have been built in 1601 (dendro-dating would be an obvious first step in any study undertaken in conjunction with repairs) and this prompts the question whether they took the place of earlier buildings. If so, does anything survive in the surfaces of the bridge or in re-used timbers to suggest what that earlier generation of buildings might have been like? Given their location, the design of their timber framing is interesting and should be compared with buildings of similar date in less exposed positions to see if modifications were thought necessary when building on a bridge. Similarly, although the buildings were probably always intended to have shops at ground floor, without any ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáback-yard‰Û¡ÌÝå» all other functions would have been on upper floors. This means that domestic space may have been organised differently in this building compared with contemporaries. A comparative study with more conventionally located structures would bring important insights into both types of building. Finally we should ask whether the development of commercial properties on the bridge in the 16th century is related to the re-organisation of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s markets during this century. Certainly markets which had formerly been more scattered were brought together during the 16th century into this part of High Street (RAZ 10.22.9), providing an important commercial opportunity on High Bridge which may not have been so valuable at earlier periods.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include not just the presently visible bridge structure but approximately 20m to the north and 100m to the south in order to incorporate the full extent of the surviving buried abutments. To the south-west there is an interesting and important relationship between this RAZ and St Benedict‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church (RAZ 9.60.20, 10.60.20). The chronological relationship between the two structures is of great interest and, consequently, the two RAZs are drawn with a considerable overlap.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.15,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.15,

401bb68f-e7f2-467c-87eb-824556cba138,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Northgate and Church Lane Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌNorthgate and Church Lane Character Area is an inner city suburban area lying northeast of the Roman and Medieval upper city defences, along the summit of the north escarpment. Much of the area remained as open agricultural land until the Early Industrial period, however its proximity to the city centre has strongly influenced its development. The suburban townscape survives as an expression of the individual wealth generated during and subsequent to Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s industrial expansion during the late 19th and 20th centuries. The status of the houses is reflected in their large scale, expansive plots and often lavishly decorated form. Many of the extensive garden plots pertaining to the large Late Victorian/Edwardian and earlier residences have been subject to infill during the Inter-war, Post-war and Modern periods. As a result many of the later housing plot boundaries incorporate elements of 19th century plot boundaries.The majority of urban blocks are composed of large-scale detached houses built within spacious plots, resulting in a low overall building density. However, density increases along Church Lane where a number of semi-detached and terraced properties are built within comparatively smaller plots and positioned closer to the road, illustrating the prominence of Church Lane, and creating a gradual transition to more urban areas. Throughout the remainder of the area buildings are set back from the road towards the front and centre of their plots. The houses have doors and windows overlooking the street creating a sense of activity and security. However, houses along main roads have tall public/private boundaries, which create a feeling of inactivity along streets and a higher sense of enclosure that is further increased by mature trees within plots. Late Victorian/Edwardian houses are almost entirely two storeys in height, are built of brick, have vertical windows, including many surviving wooden sliding sashes, and have complex roofs with one or more gabled features built into the main gabled or hipped roof. The form and decoration of properties is highly individual, ranging from more plainly decorated symmetrical houses, to more structurally complex and highly ornate properties. A large proportion of the decoration is loosely classical in style, although there are some examples of other architectural styles, such as Victorian Gothic and Tudor. Within the Character Area there are a dispersed number of houses dating to and after the Inter-war period. In general properties are plainer, and become increasingly plain towards the end of the Modern period. Houses are built of brick and have few decorative features. Open space in the Character Area is area is mainly private mature gardens within large plots. The abundance of mature vegetation, notably trees, is a key suburban characteristic of the area. Views within the Character Area are limited to those along streets, and are mostly dominated by mature trees, though there are occasional glimpses of the Cathedral towers.Roads in the Character Area carry high volumes of traffic, and converge in the south of the Character Area to form an important transport node immediately north east of the historic core of the city.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 84,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,18,

As it is north of the Great Gowt, our current understanding of the development of the suburb (RAZ 9.33) suggests it ought to have been founded by the mid 11th century, and it may belong to a somewhat earlier period.

4234790c-1568-43cd-9a9d-e798d5064e5e,LARA RAZ AREA,,Early cemetery in the Wigford area,"Finds of cemetery material have been confined to the area around Monson Street and St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall. This might represent a burial ground on a second sand island, as there is, potentially, a second early watercourse south of St Peter-at-Gowts church and, were it to be insular, the cemetery will be co-terminus with the island. It seems more likely, however, that this cemetery extended further south and south-east beyond Sincil Dyke and included the finds of Military period cremations in the vicinity of the Malandry Closes. The important early cremation cemetery in the area around Monson Street and St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall should be seen against the backdrop of the early ritual significance of the pools. Mr Jones has indicated that rites in use at one of the funerals was distinctively Roman, rather than Romano-British, but that there have also been finds, such as the mirror, which are more typical of late Iron Age burial rituals. Further work on this cemetery needs to explore not just its boundaries, demography and date, but also the character of the rites involved.",Summary,"Recorded cremations and potentially early Roman funerary monuments occur in two discrete blocks. The northern one extends on both sides of High Street and appears to be bounded on the south by Great Gowt, and on the west, north and east by the Roman line of the Witham and waterlogged ground. Since it is not certain that there are indeed two separate cemeteries, the boundaries of the RAZ are set to include the archaeologically unknown area between the two.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.6,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.6,

425e79b7-73c7-43e1-95c5-82384795ea20,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Newark Road Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌNewark Road Character Area mainly consists of a high density of residential housing located either side of Newark Road, which forms a spine running north/south through the centre of the Character Area. Dispersed groups of shops, as well as an area of light industry, are also located along the main road.Buildings within the area form part of a Late Victorian/Edwardian residential suburb, the backbone of which consists of more commercial properties along Newark Road. In part, the area is a linear extension of central Lincoln, which, at its most southern limit, has absorbed parts of the once outlying village of Bracebridge. Housing lying to the rear of properties fronting Newark Road represents the consolidation of linear development along the road during the Late Victorian/Edwardian and ensuing Inter-War, Post-War, and Modern Periods.Newark Road broadly follows the route of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáFosse Way‰Û¡ÌÝå», a Roman road that provided the main southerly access route into the Roman Colonia. The road, which was re-established during the medieval era, runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, the banks of which have been successively altered since the medieval era if not before. Much of the land remained as open farmland until the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period, when most of the housing in the area was constructed. Some remnants of the former landscape survive in the current townscape, such as the alignment of field boundaries. During the 20th century, remaining open space in the Character Area, as well as some industrial sites, were redeveloped primarily for housing.The majority of the townscape is divided up into continuous rows of Late Victorian/Edwardian terraces aligned off Newark Road and an area of small/medium scale public and private Modern apartment blocks and housing bordering the River Witham. Late Victorian/Edwardian and Modern buildings along Newark Road include a mixture of residential and commercial properties, as well as some public buildings, which contribute to a more urban feeling along the road. Although different in style and layout, Modern and Late Victorian/Edwardian buildings share common attributes, notably in their scale, materials and construction.The prevalence of Late Victorian/Edwardian properties is a characteristic of the Newark Road Character Area. They are highly coherent in style, form and construction, resulting in a regular pattern of narrow fronted houses along streets, except towards the north of the area where houses are notably larger in scale and more individual in character. Architectural detail and subtle changes of scale and construction in Late Victorian/Edwardian properties serve to differentiate individual or groups of buildings from other terraces within the Character Area. The apparent variation in the architectural character of terraced houses is likely to be indicative of the varying social structure of streets within the suburb. Many original features of the Late Victorian/Edwardian townscape have been replaced with modern materials, in particular windows, doors and rainwater goods, as well as elements of the streetscape.Modern buildings in Newark Road Character Area consist of three broad types including blocks of public apartments, small areas of infill or redevelopment within the Late Victorian/Edwardian townscape, and groups of semi-detached properties and short rows of terraces. The form and style of housing vary between each small development; however, within individual areas, buildings are coherent in form. With the exception of some infill houses, Modern developments were built on flood plain land adjacent to the River Witham including a former caravan park, open green space and marsh. Open space in the Character Area is mostly limited to private garden space, the banks of the River Witham and Sincil Dyke. However, land to the west of the area is an important amenity providing immediate access into the rural landscape of the north escarpment.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 68,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,93,

The narrowest gap between the 5m contours on the valley sides today is between the northern terminal of the Wigford ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápeninsula‰Û¡ÌÝå» and the Stonebow area, but the study of soils from excavations in Wigford in the last 30 years has shown that Wigford is a Roman construction (RAZ 6.2 below). Consequently, in the pre-Roman period, the shortest potential crossing point lay much further east, in the Stamp End area, between the bank-side road called Stamp End and the Great Northern Terrace area. The proposal that this was the early crossing point seems to be proved by the prodigious quantities of metalwork finds of later Bronze Age and later date which have been discovered in the river itself and in its banks ‰Û¡ÌÝÌábelow Stamp End lock‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Davey 1973; Stocker and Everson 2003). Even if one does not regard these finds as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌávotive‰Û¡ÌÝå», other explanations for them such as military defeat, or even casual loss still imply a crossing point in this vicinity in the late Bronze Age. It has been pointed out recently that such finds are the hall-mark of early crossings of the Witham fens to the east and south-east, between Lincoln and Tattershall (Stocker and Everson 2003). Given the similarity of archaeological profile, the presence of a late Bronze Age causeway in the Stamp End area is highly likely and it has been included within the list of these structures (Ibid.). Furthermore the continued presence of a causeway in this approximate location is strongly suggested by the continuing sequence of finds which extends right up to the 11th century AD and, in addition to 15 Bronze Age items, includes six of the Iron Age (ibid.). Further work in the RAZ should address the questions common to sites where votive deposits are expected. Ritual and symbolic explanations are likely to co-exist with functional ones, and future research must address these ritual and symbolic questions as well as functional ones to do with the construction techniques etc. (cf. eg, Bradley 1998)Any structural remains of the causeway itself are likely to be of very great importance, although posing problems for excavators. It is likely to be represented by complex structures of wood, within and below the peat, which, given favourable ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáwet‰Û¡ÌÝå» conditions, will have survived in a condition similar to the similar causeway structure at Flag Fen (Pryor 1991). Furthermore it is also highly likely that great quantities of Bronze Age and later metalwork objects - many of high quality - will be found both around the causeways structures themselves and also in the peat to the east and west (RAZ 5.7).",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ in the late Bronze and Iron Age are unknown. Furthermore, it is likely that there were many crossing points at different periods. The RAZ is therefore conceived as a broad strip across the floor of the valley linking the land above the 5m contour to north and south, not far from the point where the gap is at its narrowest. No causeway is recorded in documents until AD 1455, when it occupied a line in the general vicinity of the modern Stamp End Lock (chapter 9a - cf. especially 9/66). It is likely, however, that in earlier periods it would have occupied lines further to the east. The RAZ is also intended to include strips at least 100m wide to either sides of the causeways themselves, where (according to the evidence of parallel examples) there will be a pattern of deposition of votive deposits associated with it.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,5.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,5.2,

We have no information establishing when the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáinstitutional‰Û¡ÌÝå» character of St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s ceased, but the final references to the hospital are in the mid 14th century, and by the late medieval period it seems to have settled into the role of a chapel and burial ground for the cathedral community, although its development might also have been stimulated by the presence of the Battle Place, at or near which we have noted that judicial executions took place (RAZ 10.46.1). Cathedral records, however, are surprisingly silent about the use of this graveyard and it may be that it fell out of use as a burial ground rapidly. Certainly there were no parishioners in the parish in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287). Even so the chapel (from which one presumes the burial services would have been conducted) was reconstructed as a chapel of ease 18ft by 14ft and 14ft high in 1466-70 (Lincs. Archives D&C Ms. A.2.36), which presumably demonstrates that it was largely the cathedral interest in the church which kept it going. Although apparently damaged during the Civil War, this small structure survived until the 18th century and appears on the Bucks‰Û¡ÌÝå» 1743 panorama. By the 17th century, however, it seems to have been converted for domestic accommodation (Cameron 1985, 118). This curious status and the conversions involved will be of considerable interest. The only chance of understanding how the church functioned in the Early Modern Era will come from archaeology. The disposition of fittings within the chapel should provide important information regarding its ritual functions at different times and should allow us to pinpoint the moments of change. It will be interesting to see whether there is any sudden change in ritual layout at the time of the Reformation, when the elaboration of the funeral rite was discontinued, for example. It is possible that the former hospital enclosure was also converted for domestic uses, but we have no documentary evidence for this.",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries are all speculative. We can say that the church and hospital were sited to the west of Battle Place, whose location is approximately fixed (RAZ 9.46). Similarly we know, from many early post-medieval references (Cameron 1985, 189) that there was a close between St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and the cliff edge in which a windmill or mills were established (RAZ 9.43). This leaves us with a long rectilinear strip of land extending from the castle ditch in the east to the windmill closes in the west, bounded on the south and east by Battle Place and to the north by Cliffgate. It is possible, however, that at least at earlier stages in the development of the suburb, the frontage along this street was occupied with houses (RAZ 9.27).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.57,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.57,

Now that we suspect that some of the more peripheral churches like St Peter ad fontem (RAZ 9.60.12) were being founded in the mid 11th century, and now that we have excavated evidence that churches such as St Mark's (RAZ 9.60.25) were already a century old by then, it may no longer be safe to presume that St Michael is of great antiquity. On the other hand the church is located directly outside the south gate of the upper city and so bears direct comparison with St Nicholas Newport (RAZ 9.60.2), St Peter Eastgate (RAZ 9.60.4) and, perhaps, St Bartholomew (RAZ 9.60.3). St Michael dedications are also sometimes indicators of antiquity (as at St Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s outside Lichfield - Morris 1989), but they are also often given to churches on prominent hill top locations - like here. There is, then, a clear interest in the foundation date of this church. It could have been an early example, possibly even pre-Viking, and related to the upper city enclosure in the Early Medieval Era (RAZ 8.1, 8.3.4). Alternatively, it could have been a foundation related to the hypothetical High Market of the High Medieval Era (RAZ 9.22). St Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s does not just resemble St Nicholas and St Peter Eastgate in being outside the gates, but all three churches are also located at the point at which market places emerge from the upper walled enclosure. Although the church rebuilt in 1739 (Hill 1966, 65) was in the northern part of the modern graveyard, the medieval structure was to the south, near the site of the 1853 building. We need to recover what remains of the medieval building, suggested by topographical and documentary sources to have been quite a fine one. The church stood close to the west gate of the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace, and it may be that it benefited from episcopal patronage, and it was the headquarters of the prominent guild of Corpus Christi, which implies a distinctive guild chapel (Hill 1948, 298). The site extends across two terraces, resulting in a churchyard on two levels and we should be interested in the question of whether these terraces pre-date the foundation of the churchyard, or whether they represent an expansion of the churchyard during the medieval period. The graveyard is likely to contain a well-preserved population and should be fully investigated rather than sampled.",Summary,"The RAZ includes the whole of the modern graveyard, which is thought to be follow the same boundaries as that of its medieval predecessor on the south, west and east sides. To the north, however, it is likely that the churchyard extended up to the foot of the upper city wall.

The area has a strong east/west orientation throughout, with buildings and road/rail infrastructure sharing a common orientation similar to that within other Character Areas along and off High Street.Much of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s urban form is associated with the integration of the Great Northern Railway station into the pre-existing Early Industrial townscape, and subsequent urban growth in the Post-Railway Expansion Period. However, some earlier elements and features survive including the route of the former Roman road in the alignment of High Street, the line of a former medieval burgage plot that forms the southern boundary of the Character Area, and the culverted route of Sincil Dyke that flows beneath the Character Area.Building density in the Character Area is low, with buildings limited to Central Station and a cluster of 19th-century buildings along the north side of St. Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street. There is an open sense of enclosure throughout most of the Character Area, which heightens towards High Street, where buildings and the railway station help define a broad public ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásquare‰Û¡ÌÝå». There is a horizontal emphasis throughout much of the Character Area, with long and low linear features and open areas such as walls, car parks, roads and buildings.Central Station is a landmark building in the area, and is set back from the road facing a deep forecourt with car parking. The station is built in the Tudor revival style, and comprises a main two- to three-storey entrance building, a three-storey tower and two single-storey wings to the east and west. The station and much of its associated infrastructure is built of yellow brick, which is a distinguishing feature in the southern half of the Character Area. The station forecourt is surfaced with red block paving and is bound to the north by a line of mature trees. Open car parks to the east and west of the station are surfaced in tarmac and are defined by yellow brick walls in English Bond with some surviving cast-iron railings. The eastern car park is crossed by a doglegged footbridge, which includes an older cast-iron section with solid iron parapets to the south, which is an important and well-used access route to the south.There is a large amount of railway infrastructure within the Character Area, much of which is original, including large areas of open track and sidings, a part cast-iron footbridge in the east, and a yellow brick signal box in the west.Commercial properties along the north of St. Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street mainly date to the 19th century, and are mostly individual buildings, except for a short row of terraced shops. Buildings are two to four storeys in height, and range from a single bay to 8/9 bays in width. Properties are built of small-scale materials including brick, and are located at the back of the footway (except 11a) facing the street. Properties have active frontages with doors and windows looking out on the footpath. Roofs are in slate and pitched, except on extensions, and are gabled or hipped with shallow plain eaves and verges. Shop fronts have low solid-to-void ratios at ground-floor level, with wide windows separated by narrow wooden mullions, low stallrisers, deep fascias, and doorways with partially glazed doors. The style and extent of decoration on buildings varies, and includes elaborate shop fronts incorporating first-floor canted wooden bay windows set beneath deep eaves, stone dressings on window surrounds and recessed doorways, and some loose classical-style decoration.St. Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street is three to four lanes in width, but mostly functions as a wide two-lane road due to bus stops and a taxi rank on the north and south sides of the street respectively. Oxford Street is two lanes in width. Both roads become ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáone-way‰Û¡ÌÝå» around the traffic islands in the centre/north of the Character Area. There is a large variety of street furniture, which includes a number of benches within and around the station forecourt, tall modern street lamps, and road infrastructure including large signs, pedestrian crossings, cast-iron and concrete bollards, traffic lights and steel pedestrian fencing. Varied street furniture and paving materials produce a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácluttered‰Û¡ÌÝå» and incoherent street scene. A large proportion of the Character Area consists of open space, much of which is within the station compound. The remainder is mainly public space, including the large station forecourt, wide pavements and the broad carriageway of St. Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street which help define a broad ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásquare‰Û¡ÌÝå» in part.Tree cover and vegetation in the Character Area are limited, and include small areas of planting and the east/west line of trees running from the church of St. Mary le Wigford to the far east of the Character Area.Views within the Character Area are mostly confined to east/west views along St. Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street and the railway lines. Views to the west are dominated by Wigford House and the NCP multi-storey car park. Views to the east are confined by Pelham Bridge.The Character Area is well connected with High Street to the west and Sincil Street to the north. In contrast, the eastern and southern boundaries of the area are poorly connected due to the largely impermeable boundaries of Pelham Bridge and the train station compound respectively. As a result, the footbridge over the railway lines in the south east of the Character Area is a well-used and essential access point.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 34,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,66,

460fdb20-0843-4a6b-a468-bbe9815d07ff,LARA RAZ AREA,,Augustinian Friary,"The four friaries of the major orders (Augustinian, Carmelite, Dominican and Franciscan) in Lincoln represent a good group nationally, and in addition, Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s exceptionally rare example of the Friary of the Sack (extinct by 1307) continued in religious use in the early part of the Early Modern Era. The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In the course of the final two centuries of their existence we should be interested in adaptations to the churches and other claustral buildings which may cast light on the changing attitudes of the orders to their rules and to their relationship with the secular world. In the post-Dissolution period these sites retain considerable interest. Their archaeology should cast light on the attitudes of the new secular owners to the old religion; was it deliberately denigrated or were its monuments treated with dignity and respect? In the case of the Carmelite Friary and St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Conduit we may have rare evidence for the latter attitude. In all of these cases we must be aware that the fraternal buildings are likely to have converted for secular uses at the Dissolution. Little is known about these conversions in Lincoln or elsewhere and the chance should be taken to study this important aspect of early modern archaeology as well as the archaeology of these Friaries themselves.The Augustinian Friary in Newport remains little known in the Early Modern Era, yet its site has been the least compromised by subsequent development and it may, therefore, offer the most intact archaeological sequence. In the course of the final two centuries of its existence we should be interested in the development and adaptation of the friary, both the church and the conventual buildings. Changes to such structures should be assessed for their contribution to our understanding of the changing attitudes of the friars to their Rule and to their relationships with the lay public. The church, in particular, will preserve, in its design and furnishing, evidence for the development of late medieval piety and dogma, and the identification of such changes should be a priority in subsequent work.In the post-Dissolution period, the archaeology of the Austin Friary should cast light on the attitudes of the new secular owners to the old religion; was the site deliberately denigrated or were its monuments treated with dignity and respect? Little is known about the conversion of friary sites to private houses in Lincoln (or elsewhere) and because of the relatively undisturbed nature of the Austin Friary, the chance should be taken to study this important aspect of early modern archaeology. One of the present buildings on the site (23 Newport) is of some antiquity and reuses medieval masonry in some of its walls and may represent (in part) a conversion of fraternal buildings. Development work on this important building should be undertaken under archaeological supervision, as even if it does not retain in situ Friary fabric, the masonry of which it is built will be of interest in its own right. Although very little seems to be documented about the conversion of the Friary in secular hands, on this site we are offered a relatively straight-forward opportunity to study the dissolution of a complete fraternal precinct in the Early Modern Era.",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to follow and include the presumed precinct boundary, extracted from early mapping.

Like St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s also, the church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s development was arrested in the 14th century and it has fewer architectural features of later date; in this sense it is a barometer of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s late medieval decline. However, this is only part of the story as we have some evidence that St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s did benefit from substantial patronage from the mercantile elite after the collapse of the cloth trade. Most spectacularly it was the site of the chantry of Ralph Jolyff, founded in 1347 (Venables 1887-8, 332). The chantry was provided with a purpose-built chapel at the east end of the south aisle. This is the best documented parochial chantry chapel still visible in the city and fabric analysis should be undertaken to understand the arrangement of liturgical fittings here before the Reformation, and the way in which they were altered subsequently. Much of the remainder of the church was rebuilt in the 19th century, but the south aisle and tower still preserve medieval fabric and any repairs here should be accompanied by detailed recording aimed at elucidating the changing patterns of liturgical use through the Early Modern Era. To the north of the modern church a portion of the graveyard has been adopted by the modern vicarage. We have no information about the location of the medieval clergy house, but it is possible that such a building may have occupied this large space north of the church. Works involving ground disturbance in this area should be monitored to see if information about earlier structures on this site can be recovered (like those at St John Wigford - 10.60.23- St Mary-le-Wigford 10.60.26 and St Botolph 10.60.21).

The church was one of those demolished by order of the City Council starting in 1551 (a relatively late date, which suggests that it may have been in a good condition), but stone was still being sold from the site ten years later (Stocker 1990, 21). Questions raised by this demolition are similar to those raised in the cases of St Andrew Wigford (RAZ 10.60.19), St Stephen (RAZ 10.60.14) and a number of others which were demolished in the 1550s or 1560s.

Although first reported in the later 13th century, as with the markets on the hillside (RAZ 10.22), references continue into the late 15th century (Cameron 1985, 21, 114-5). However, there seem to be none any later than 1490 and this might suggest that, like the hillside markets, it was either closed or moved to the High Street around and south of the Stonebow during the course of the 16th century. Some evidence for this proposal might be discovered on the triangular market place itself or in the sequence of development of the properties along the north, west and south sides, and the RAZ is drawn to include both the market place and the properties. Investigations in future might focus on whether the market really did disappear or whether (as thread is a durable commodity) some, at least, of the market activity became transferred to shops on the site - perhaps shops built on the ground covered by booths in the former market place. Even if this is not how the market space was infilled, the properties there are clearly in-filling, and some investigation of their origin would be helpful. This could be investigation below ground, but it is also possible that the largely 19th-century facades of the modern buildings on this site conceal earlier structures, which might cast light on the development of this rather awkward plot of land.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include both the market place and the properties along the north, west and south sides, including the churchyard of Holy Trinity church.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.23,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.23,

It is one of that group of churches (along with St John-the-Poor (RAZ 9.60.34) and St Cuthbert (RAZ 9.60.37)) which may owe their origins to the layout of a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáHigh Market‰Û¡ÌÝå» on the slopes of the hillside in the 10th or 11th century (RAZ 9.22). Once the rows of booths in this hypothetical early market had solidified into lanes with permanent buildings, St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s stood in the market of the skinners or parchment-makers. This street was, presumably, where the tanners sold their products and, as Lincoln was a centre for leather production, it was probably quite an important market. St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s in Wigford (RAZs 9.60.26, 9.60.25) St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, St John-the-Poor and St Cuthbert may owe their origins to the initiative of a group of merchants rather than that of an individual lord. Although a communal foundation of this type is perhaps more likely, it has been suggested that St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s might represent a much earlier foundation, and this possibility should be explored in further work. Signs that the church might have been of earlier date than the market are said to be the fact that it was called a 'monasterium' in a document of 1155-75 from Peterborough Abbey (Cameron 1985,133), the dedication to St Peter, and the fact that it was adjacent to the site of a well, which Venables (1887-8, 338) maintained was regarded as a holy well. The relationship of the churchyard to the terraces running across the hillside at this point is not understood.The church was apparently disused by 1461 (Hill 1948, 287n) and this may suggest that the graveyard will contain an important sealed population, which should be examined as a complete population and not piecemeal.",Summary,"The site of the graveyard is known. The south-eastern boundary was Michaelgate (formerly Parchmentgate), the south-western Spring Hill. To the south-west, Dr Vince has suggested that Spring Hill may be a relatively late feature in the topography (RAZ 9.50.1). If this is true then the churchyard may have extended across what is now the road and a small triangular piece of land now cut off on the west side of Spring Hill may represent a corner of the original graveyard. The northern boundary of the churchyard is not known, but is taken to be represented by the terrace wall which now separates the buildings on the north side of St Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Terrace from those on the south.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.36,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.36,

The layout of the building, and its architectural details and fittings, represent the state of doctrinal thinking at the turn of the century, and several commentators believe the building to be one of the finest by this architect. Consequently, alterations and repairs should be accompanied by recording programmes aimed at comparing such details at All Saints with similar details from some of the earlier churches. In this way we can chart how thinking on such matters had developed through the 19th century. All Saints is in a similar position relative to the new suburb as St Faith, Charles Street West (which was also designed by Hodgson Fowler in 1895) (RAZ 11.92.3) and, of all of the new churches comparisons with St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s are likely to be the most informative.",Summary,The RAZ includes the church plot mapped on the 2nd edition O.S. map.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.92.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.92.1,

Even so, we are still unsure about the development of this waterside from the mid 11th century onwards and further work here should be undertaken where it is clear that deposits survive. All deposits in this RAZ are likely to be of importance because their waterlogged character may ensure the survival, particularly, of organic rubbish dumped behind newly constructed waterfronts as make-up. To the west of High Bridge, there has been little significant archaeological work on the waterfront. We need to know whether the sequence of development of the waterfront in this area is markedly different from that to the east of High Bridge, as we suspect it might be (the 13th-century water front here had a stone-built quayside for example). In the later Middle Ages (12th and 13th centuries), however, this waterfront may have been industrial rather than commercial, as it adjoined the cloth production quarter and the dyeing and fulling processes would have been dependent on river water for their considerable needs.",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries are drawn along the north bank of the Witham, with the High Street to the west, the city wall to the east and the northern side of Saltergate to the north.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.3,

There is no indication that the parish included a great percentage of the city elite, although it is hardly marginally placed and the obit of William de Belay was established in the church in 1384 (ed. Gibbon 1888, 31) which may have had some structural consequences. The Vicars Choral told Bishop Alnwick‰Û¡ÌÝå»s visitation of the Dean and Chapter in 1437 that the Precentor had destroyed (prosteruit) the churches of St Peter Stanthaket and St Edmund (ed. Woolley 1913, 26). According to Major (ed. 1958, vi) the parish was united with St Michael-on-the-Mount before 1461. The church ought, therefore, to provide a good case study for the pre-Reformation redundancy of a minor parish church unaffected by Reformation changes in liturgical layout. It will also be a matter of interest to see whether the Precentor had been attempting to capitalise on the site by redeveloping the land, and if so, what account he took of the earlier, sacred, use of the site. Were parts of the site avoided in its subsequent re-use, for example, and what treatment was accorded to disturbed burials?",Summary,"The site of the church is only approximately known. It was at the northern end of the block between Bank Street and Free School Lane and the fact that it is sometimes called 'iuxta Minores' may suggest that it faced on to the latter street.

4a775b39-ad12-4813-863f-28c9e8cd5702,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,St. Giles Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSt. Giles Character Area is a large public residential housing estate located in the north west of the city between the Nettleham and Wragby main roads. Its design and construction during the Inter-War Period was strongly influenced by the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáGarden Suburb movement‰Û¡ÌÝå», and was instigated in response to the Addison Act of 1919 and the Tudor Walters report. Many streets in the area are suburban in character, with regular mature trees, grass verges along and front and rear gardens along streets. Properties have a distinctive and mostly consistent architectural style, surviving as an example of residential expansion of Lincoln during the Inter-War Period.Several historic features, many associated with the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s rural past remain observable in the townscape. Both the Nettleham and Wragby roads may have their origins in the Roman Military Era. The northern boundary of the Character Area follows the former city boundary, originally marked by a ditch and bank known as Nettleham Mere. Field boundaries associated with the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s enclosure by Act of Parliament in the Early Industrial Period are retained in the orientation of many streets and houses in the area. The estate itself was constructed in a number of phases the first of which, in the south of the area, was built by the by the Ministry of Munitions c.1920.The area is composed of medium-sized urban blocks defined by a grid like pattern of narrow streets. The interiors of several of the larger blocks are accessed by cul-de-sacs with circular greens surrounded by houses. A large urban block located in the centre of the Character Area has several shops and public amenities around its edges, including St. Giles‰Û¡ÌÝå» Infant and Junior Schools and two places of worship, and playing fields in its centre.Based on their overall scale and form, buildings in the area are divisible into five broad categories. The majority of properties are associated with the large-scale construction of the estate. Remaining building categories include some early buildings strongly influenced by Arts and Craft style, a number of more individual properties constructed by private contractors, pre-fabricated bungalows, and small areas of modern infill. Based on the plan and basic form of properties, each building category has a set number of building types which are repeated in varying patterns along streets.Despite the variety of properties, houses have many common characteristics. There is a medium building density of properties throughout the area. Houses are two storeys in height or are bungalows, and are two to four bays in width. Properties are set back 4-8 m from the footway with forecourts, gardens and/or driveways, and occupy rectangular building plots with their short axes aligned parallel with the road. Plots are comparatively smaller in the north of the area than in the south. Houses are built of small-scale materials, including brick, and faÌÎå_ades are mostly active with doors and windows facing the street. Windows are square or horizontal in emphasis and are set high up beneath the eaves at first-floor level. Nearly all properties have been re-fenestrated with uPVC casement windows. Properties frequently have projecting bays or wings incorporated within the front faÌÎå_ade. Chimneys are mainly short brick stacks passing through the ridgeline.Some characteristics of properties within the Character Area are more variable, such as roofs, which are hipped or half-hipped, although many are gabled or have gabled elements. Roofing materials include pantiles, clay/concrete tiles, and slate. Plot boundaries are defined by a variety of materials including brick walls, privet hedge or wooden fencing.The majority of streets and housing in the Character Area are associated with the large-scale layout and construction of St. Giles during the late 1920s and 1930s. Properties of this category are mostly semi-detached or are built in rows of four, although there are a small number of rows of 6-10 houses. Properties of the same plan form are replicated along streets, and rows are often a combination of two or more semi-detached properties. Rows of properties are aligned along streets in a straight or slightly stepped pattern. Properties located on bends or circular features are aligned parallel with the road facing the carriageway. Houses are mostly plain, with simple concrete dressings. The form of houses differs mainly through the varying size, position and style of projecting wings, which are one to three bays in width. Doors are mostly half-glazed wooden or uPVC replacements set at the front of the property beneath concrete hoods, or within shared entranceways with semi-circular arches. Many properties have recently been rendered. Individual properties built by private contractors are similar in style to the majority of properties in the area; however, they are more decorative in form, and are mostly built of a more orange/red-brick.Buildings influenced by the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáneo-vernacular‰Û¡ÌÝå» and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáArts and Crafts‰Û¡ÌÝå» styles are more decorative in comparison to the majority of other houses in the area. A number of houses have mansard style or swept roofs, which often descend to ground floor level. Lower parts of roofs are swept out to incorporate deep eaves. Doorways are mostly set within porches with semi-circular archways or beneath hoods, which are integrated within the main construction of the property. Properties are semi-detached or are arranged in short rows of four to ten houses. Properties of the same plan form are often arranged in symmetrical patterns along streets, and large rows are often centrally placed within or opposite urban blocks. Buildings are stepped around bends in the roads, rather than directly facing the street. Groups of small, detached prefabricated bungalows either side of Outer Circle Drive are arranged in pairs of short stepped rows of two or three bungalows facing each other and running perpendicular to the road, or in linear groups facing a wide green verge running parallel to the road. The houses are set within large, often square plots, the boundaries of which are indistinctly defined at the front. Properties have shallow gabled corrugated steel roofs with small squat brick-built chimneystacks passing through the ridgeline. Doors are set at the front of houses with small convex hoods. All buildings of this category have been faced in brick and rendered during the Modern Period.Modern buildings in the Character Area include a number of small areas of infill development. Properties are built in varying colours of brick, and are generally more decorative than other houses in St. Giles. Modern houses are often poorly connected with other areas of the estate as they are segregated by tall brick walls or steel security fencing, accessed by cul-de-sacs, and often aligned with their sides facing the road, leading to a feeling of inactivity along streets.Streets in the Character Area have narrow two-car width tarmac carriageways with concrete kerbs, tarmac or concrete paved footpaths and grass verges. East/west roads are relatively wider and carry higher volumes of traffic.

4b3b7a69-8424-491e-ad06-b90205e5afb8,LARA RAZ AREA,,The Jurassic Way,"The earliest known archaeological feature within the city seems to be the so called ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáJurassic Way‰Û¡ÌÝå», a Prehistoric track which is thought to have extended from the Humber southwards for an unknown distance along the crest of the Jurassic scarp (Grimes 1951). Further south, the very existence of the Jurassic Way in Lincolnshire has been doubted (Taylor 1979, 32-6) but it has also been argued that a routeway along the cliff edge is very likely to have been a very ancient feature of the landscape, even if it was not part of a long-distance route. The date of this feature is unknown, and probably unknowable - presumably this dry route with its wide views along the level plateau was always an attractive route to north-south traffic and could easily extend back into the Mesolithic. Where the track entered the Lincoln gap, a route down into the valley had to be selected, leading to a crossing point over the main channel of the Witham. Although our understanding of the pre-Roman Witham valley is imperfect, nevertheless we can now be sure that the peninsula of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhigh‰Û¡ÌÝå» ground (above the 5m contour) on which Wigford now stands did not exist prior to the Roman period (RAZ 6.2). Consequently, much the shortest route across the wetlands, below the 5m contour, was located well to the east, in the general vicinity of what is now Stamp End (RAZ 5.2), and so the Jurassic Way presumably aimed for that point. The archaeology of the track itself will not be easily recognised, not will it be easy to understand. The chances of collecting dating evidence for its earliest surfaces anywhere except at the river crossing are very small. Even so, any evidence for track construction or repair will be a major step forward, indicating some level of responsible local authority as well as the presence of long-distance travel.",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ have been drawn making the assumption that the track will have held to the line of the ridge crests for as long as possible before taking a direct route diagonally across the slope towards the terminals of the crossing point. A width of 100m has been selected as appropriate to cover the variety of different lines which the track might have taken over time, but this is arbitrary and we can be certain that it did not deviate far from the cliff edge in its northern and southern sectors. At the cliff tops north and south of the gap itself, the RAZ boundaries have been placed wider apart to accommodate possible short-cuts and more direct routes from the valley floor to the cliff-edge paths.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,5.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,5.1,

If there were organised Iron Age field systems of the type commonly seen in air photographs on the Lincoln Edge further north, this is where they will have been. A study of the air-photographic archive prior to 1950 might produce some evidence for such field systems. Archaeological work in these areas might expect to find occasional field ditches which are the principal source of information about this agricultural economy. The land below the cliff face to the west of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáJurassic Way‰Û¡ÌÝå» both north and south of the river crossing is likely to have been favourable for settlement, above the 5m contour, and otherwise will have provided good summer pasture for livestock. The find of an undated field boundary ditch below alluvium, presumed to be Iron Age or Romano-British, at CFC94, near the modern football ground, may well have been a component of such a pastoral landscape which succumbed to encroaching fen in the Roman era (Trimble 1994a). We should note that it seemed to be aligned on the proposed line of the Stamp End causeway and the Fosse Way. The fen edge itself (along the 5m contour) will have been an important zone for economic exploitation, with fishing and fowling being undertaken as well as the collection of eggs and reeds. Enough work has been done nationally to suggest that, by the late Pre-Roman Iron Age, this part of the territory of the Corieltauvi was ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáa country of villages and open settlements‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Millet 1990, fig.4; Winton 1998, 51-2). Any such ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáopen settlements‰Û¡ÌÝå» within the city limits ought to be located either on the limestone plateau north of the modern city centre, or in the meadow land at the foot of the cliff, north and south of the gap.",Summary,"The RAZ is two parts: the northern part is marked by the foot of the scarp on the on the western and southern sides, and by the city boundary on the northern and eastern sides.

4b79e75d-5772-4253-811a-0be614e8b0e2,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Turner Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌTurner is a mainly residential suburban Character Area with housing built in the Post-War Period [1946-1966] and in a style of architecture influenced by Modernism. A key characteristic of the Character Area are the large open grassed spaces in front of buildings and large building setbacks. It is an inward-looking area with very limited connectivity to surrounding areas and an impermeable western boundary. In spite of the wide spaces between buildings there is a reasonable/good sense of enclosure for a suburb derived from the building line, constant height of the buildings and the public/private boundaries. Buildings in the Character Area are mostly two-storey red or brown brick houses, both semi-detached and rows, with minimal decoration. Although the Character Area is mostly quiet with little vehicular or pedestrian traffic there is a small area of vitality around the row of shops at the east end of Turner Avenue.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 96,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,94,

4c071bc7-fcf2-4e0e-82ef-5bed6c8d3f28,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Newport Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌNewport Character Area lies along the former Roman road, Ermine Street, running directly north of the former Roman and Medieval walled cities. The townscape is strongly influenced by the former Roman and Medieval townscapes, in particular the medieval suburb of Newport. Farmhouses, cottages and field boundaries associated with the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s former agricultural use during and prior to the Early Industrial period also survive in the Character Area.Newport is a straight road with frequent smaller streets and cul-de-sacs running broadly perpendicularly off it, resulting in a grid pattern of streets. The road carries high volumes of traffic and properties along its length fulfil a wide variety of functions resulting in a strong sense of vitality throughout much of the daytime and evening. Properties along Newport, including those located on corners, face the street, recognising the significant role of the road. The area has an incoherent and complex townscape, characterised by a wide variety of buildings of differing uses, deriving from a complex development of a High Medieval suburb to the Modern day. Buildings date from the Early Modern Period to the Modern period. There is a changing density of buildings, which are built in varying sizes within mostly narrow rectangular plots perpendicular to the carriageway, leading to a varied building line along Newport. Properties consist of detached and semi-detached buildings, and short rows of terraced houses. In general terms, large detached buildings located towards the centre or rear of plots whereas the majority of small-scale properties located at the back of the footway. The public/private boundaries of houses are defined in a wide variety of materials and changing heights along the road, adding to the changing character of the townscape either side of Newport.The varied townscape illustrates plot-by-plot development of the Character Area. Due to the varying form, scale, style and decoration of buildings, properties in the area are often individual in character. However, buildings of similar age and of the same plan form share many common elements. Many terraced buildings along Newport have been converted into shops. Shop frontages are diverse in style, and are often built using modern materials. There are several civic buildings within the area, including the vacant Newport Drill Hall, St. Nicholas‰Û¡ÌÝå» Church, Bishop Grosseteste University College, and a group of four buildings in the south of the area, illustrating the long-standing status of Newport as one of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s main roads.Open space is often characterised by mature vegetation, planting as well as lawned areas, all of which contribute to a more suburban feeling. Several accessible small public open spaces are located along Newport although the majority of open space within the area is composed of private plots‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 72,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,15,

4c927bff-fb02-4022-a18a-c152bf4ae29c,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Priory and St Sepulchre‰Û¡ÌÝå»s hospital,"St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Priory, to the west of the green just outside Great Bargate, was much the largest and most important of the Lincoln monasteries and, as in the High Medieval Era, it has much to offer the study of late medieval monasticism and the post-Dissolution fate of monastic property. We know from documentary sources that the hospital of St Sepulchre continued as a separate institution, managed by the Gilbertine Priory but distinct from it. To judge from late medieval bequests, St Sepulchre‰Û¡ÌÝå»s seems to have developed a particular specialism in the care of orphaned and sick children (see e.g. ed. Foster 1914, 212 for index of at least 37 bequests to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápupils and orphans of St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s‰Û¡ÌÝå» in citizens‰Û¡ÌÝå» wills written between 1271 and 1526). The hospital continued to be active right up until its dissolution, and its archaeology offers an excellent opportunity to study charity and piety in the city on the eve of the Reformation.As in earlier periods, future investigations within the RAZ should explore the division between the hospital and the monastery to the south to establish what level of communication was permitted by the two institutions.South of the hospital, the late medieval monastery itself provides an interesting comparison with the recently excavated Gilbertine Priory of St Andrew in a comparable position outside the walls of York (Kemp and Graves 1996). At St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s there was a comprehensive rebuilding of the monastery in the 14th century which clearly reflected major changes in the implementation of the Gilbertine rule. Similar changes should be sought at St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. Changes in the layout of the buildings here might, for example, throw further light on the role of women in this house. Rose Graham believed that it was unlikely that there were ever fully-fledged canonesses here (ed. Page 1906, 189), even though there is a reference to a single canoness in the mid 14th century. Even so it is clear that there was a large community of women religious called ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásisters‰Û¡ÌÝå» in the late middle ages whose primary role seems to have been in the hospital. At the Dissolution the whole site became the property of the Duke of Suffolk, but it seems clear that he was interested in it primarily as a financial investment and he alienated it to Vincent and Thomas Grantham, leaders of one of the most prominent contemporary Lincoln families. They created St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hall in the following decades, a building of which only two views survive (one by the Bucks made in 1723 and one in the Ross Collection with no indication of its original source or date). Both these drawing show a major mansion, but there are many details which are irreconcilable and even the plan of the mansion will have to await confirmation through excavation. Research questions here should address not just the mechanics of the conversion of the monastic buildings into a great house but also the manner in which the former significance of the site for the city was transferred from religious into secular hands. For example it is known that, after the Reformation, important visitors to the city made a formal stop at the house before entering the city in the same way that such visitors had called at the Priory before entering the city in earlier times. The house was surrounded by formal earthwork gardens and although these will have been substantially damaged, some traces them may still be recoverable. Mr Everson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s studies of the earthworks of formal gardens created on the sites of former monastic sites have shown the potential interest and of the symbolism established by these features (Everson 1996; Everson and Williamson 1998, 146-50).In the last two decades, monastic archaeology has been increasingly focused on the more ephemeral elements, often buildings in the outer court.

4ccb77a1-f138-472b-8eef-2ff74219979f,LARA RAZ AREA,,Northern and southern hill slopes,"Although the discussion of the legionary territorium (RAZ 6.18) includes a mention of the natural resources available along the cliff edges on both north and south sides of the Witham gap, it is thought worthwhile to distinguish between the agricultural resources, which will have occupied much of the territorium within the District Council boundary, and resources of stone and clay, which are found only within a restricted part of it - along the hill slopes. The military fortress was constructed of timber rather than stone, of course, and this may have meant that requirements for stone in the military period would have been quite slight. Even so, it is possible that these valuable resources were first worked at this date, by cutting into the exposures along the cliffs both north and south of the Gap. The ferruginous stone (‰Û¡ÌÝÌáNorthamptonshire Ironstone‰Û¡ÌÝå»), which occurs beneath the freestone, might have been of greater importance at this early date for iron-working, Whereas we have little evidence that limestone was widely used in the Military Era, it is clear that the legion would find supplies of ironstone very useful. Roman iron-working, thought to be of a somewhat later date, was found close to the foot of the cliff at Broadgate East (BE73) and it is not impossible that this activity had its origins in the Military Era. However, no clear evidence has yet been found for early Roman iron-working in Lincoln, and future work within this RAZ should be directed towards identifying it, if at all possible. Immediately below the ironstone lie good quality clays, which were exploited for pottery manufacture in the later Roman period (RAZ 7.4.1) and, although no wares produced from it have ever been identified, future work in the RAZ should be directed towards establishing whether this resource was also exploited at this early date.",Summary,"The RAZ is in two parts, defined by the cliffs themselves north and south of the valley. They are conceived of as two strips running between the sharp edge of the hill above and the break in slope at the foot of the hill beneath. North of the valley the strip narrows as the cliff reduces in height towards the east. South of the valley the southern, western and eastern boundaries of the RAZ are defined by the modern city boundary.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.22,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.22,

The Character Area lies on an area of former scrub woodland and drained wetland in the Witham valley. St Helen‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Church is the only survival of the former medieval settlement around Boultham. Although extensively remodelled in the 19th century it retains some 13th century elements and the foundation may date from as early as the 10th or 11th century. Elements surviving from the 19th century Boultham Hall estate include the lake of 1851, the site of Boultham Hall itself, gates, a fountain, footpaths and Home Farm. Boultham Park is now a public park with large grassed areas, ornamental woodland, a yew walk, bowling green, tennis court, children‰Û¡ÌÝå»s playground and a bandstand. From the late Inter-War period [1919-1945] to the Modern period [1967-2007] a number of civic and commercial buildings were built along Boultham Park Road including Parklands Hotel, Boultham Library and Boultham Medical Practice.

4d922eef-583c-4b50-973e-a9b251b9cdba,LARA RAZ AREA,,Industrial belt south west of the city,"The area of what was probably scrubby woodland on the poor soils above the waterlogged basin may have been an important industrial resource for the colonia. The woodland itself may have provided grazing for pig herds for example (as it clearly did at Domesday) whilst the trees, if coppiced and managed, would have provided fuel both for fires in the city and also for woodland industries within the woods themselves (as it did when moorland at Boultham was granted to Bardney Abbey ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáfor burning‰Û¡ÌÝå», Thompson 1913-14, 46). Of these industries the only one for which we have any evidence as yet is the pottery industry, although charcoal burning might also be expected and perhaps even iron-working (pers. com. Jane Cowgill). A research agenda for pottery production sites of this type is provided in Fulford and Huddlestone 1991, whilst a very specific series of research questions has been posed by Darling (1977, 36-7).The pottery kilns may have been attracted to the area by easily excavated local clay deposits (Darling 1977, 32-40; Darling and Precious forthcoming), which themselves might have been revealed in the process of sand and gravel digging. Gravel and sand would have been dug for construction projects in the city and neighbourhood, and, along with clay extraction, this digging would have had a marked effect on the local topography. The pits created by such quarrying are likely to be the most frequently encountered archaeological features in this RAZ, even though features of this date may be hard to distinguish from similar features of later periods. The sites adjacent to the quarries, however, where the gravel was processed, the clay dried or the pots fired, will be easier to date and will be of the greatest interest and importance. In looking at the different production sites we should seek to distinguish between the different stages in production and see if any co-ordination between them is evident. It is not clear at present whether we are dealing with the operation of many individuals working within their own area of resources, and in competition with each other, or whether, alternatively, we have something more akin to factory production, where the scattered processes were organised by a single agency or owner, and the individual production sites were little more than locations on a single ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáconveyor-belt‰Û¡ÌÝå» of production. These areas of industrial activity will frequently be revealed as geophysical ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhot-spots‰Û¡ÌÝå» and, consequently, geophysical evaluation will be an essential preliminary to development within this RAZ. A great deal can be learnt about this area, however, through the study of bore-holes and associated systematic environmental sampling. The former should eventually give some idea of the original landforms prior to the start of extractive industry and the latter should provide information about the woodland management associated with the industries.",Summary,"The RAZ is in several parts defined by the boundary marking the change between the riparian terraces and water-logged alluvium (approximately below the 5m) contour and the gravel and clay ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhighlands‰Û¡ÌÝå» to the south and south-west. It is very noticeable that the known kiln sites mapped by Darling (1977, fig.8) all sit within 100-200m of this interface and this might demonstrate that the kilns sites themselves were deriving their clay from exposures alongside the waterways and using those same waterways for transport of their product. This apparent patterning of the kilns themselves has encouraged the definition of a band approximately 300m wide along the western, northern and eastern edges of the soils interface (ie, the RAZ boundary), within which highly significant remains of the Roman pottery industry should be expected. The city boundary provides an artificial boundary to this zone of activity along the south and west sides, and there is every reason to think the woodland and its associated industries extended some miles south and west, and finds of pottery kilns have been made at North Hykeham (Darling 1977, 34).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.3,

The church may have been in physical decay through lack of sponsorship, but it is equally possible that it had seen the replacement of public space (ie, Newport market) with private space (ie, with engrossed farmsteads), as a large number of parishioners were replaced with a small number of more elite members of society. Regardless of the decline in population, the Guild or Guilds of St Mary and St Nicholas, for example, were established in the church probably in 1339 (Westlake 1919, 166-75). Either way the archaeology of this period will be of considerable interest. St Nicholas was one of those churches which survived the Reformation and, consequently, we might expect to find good evidence for the changes in ritual function associated with those events. It met its destruction, however, during the Civil War. The circumstances surrounding its destruction are not clear. Venables (1887-8, 345) says that guns were mounted on the roof and that this caused the ruin. Sympson, however, says that it was dismantled by the defenders to give a clear field of fire from the city walls (1906, 126). Archaeological research may be able to establish which of these two versions is to be preferred. The present boundary wall is of importance in its own right. It is made of reused medieval masonry and repairs to it should be accompanied by an appropriate level of archaeological recording.",Summary,"The site of the church is known precisely. The plot continued to be marked throughout the post-medieval period, but a length of the south side was thrown into Church Lane when it was widened in 1826 (Hill 1966, 211). The north-east corner of the churchyard appears to have been encroached upon by No.1 Church Lane.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.2,

4dd4f194-8082-4d7c-8903-eaa678470247,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Westcastle,"We have very little information on the date and character of dwellings in this suburb. The pottery evidence (described by Dr Vince - chapter 9a) suggests that such properties were not present until the 12th century, following the foundation of the present Castle enclosure, and the documentary sources suggest that they had disappeared by the late 13th century. This brief period of occupation may suggest that this area had the character of an ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoverflow‰Û¡ÌÝå» when compared with more deliberately laid out suburbs such as Newport and Eastgate. Certainly this area is unlikely to have been particularly fashionable or desirable in the medieval period. The suburb contained not just the Battle Place (the site of judicial trials - RAZ 9.46) but also the city gallows, which is unlikely to have attracted settlement by the well-to-do. A further indication of the suburb's marginality is provided by the presence of at least one Leper Hospital (St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s) and possibly a second (St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s) (RAZ 9.57) . The archaeology of houses in this area will therefore be of considerable interest, although perhaps rather fragile and poorly preserved. We have very little information about the circumstances in which the most impoverished medieval citizens lived, and the Westcastle suburb may offer us a rare view into such people‰Û¡ÌÝå»s lives.",Summary,"The RAZ is in two parts. The first is along the whole of the north side of the former Cliffgate, whose location is estimated by Dr Vince, stretching 50m northwards from the estimated street front. We have no evidence for the depth of these properties and their depths may be considerably greater or less than this. The second, southern, part of the RAZ is a more complex area that changed dramatically as the era progressed. Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s analysis of the pottery from the area suggests, however, that, in its original form, between the 9th and 11th centuries there were no properties along the road which lead to the original west gate of the upper city. Once the line of Cliffgate had been re-oriented in the 12th century, however, it is likely that properties were laid out extending back from it, extending from the gate in the east to at least the edge of the cliff itself on the west. Parts of this area were subsequent occupied by other features (RAZ 9.57, RAZ 9.60.3, RAZ 9.41.1, RAZ 9.45.2, RAZ 9.46), but the whole of this zone should be investigated with questions about this short-lived, presumably domestic, settlement in mind. As on the north side of Cliffgate we have no information as to how far these properties extended to the south, but plots 50m deep have been indicated. Throughout this later period the western lip of the upper city ditch, now marked approximately by the western side of Union Road, may also have been followed by a lane which may have included some domestic occupation, at least in its northern part.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.27,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.27,

The common is known to have included a pound for impounding unauthorised animals, although, unless this pound is that located on the west side of Cross O‰Û¡ÌÝå»Cliff Hill (RAZ 11.6.1), the structure has yet to be located. Like those at West Common, however, the South Common commoners also had to share their rights with other uses such as rifle ranges (RAZ 11.84.2). There were experimental workings looking for ironstone here in the 1870s, but it is not clear if these workings were fully documented (Hill 1974, 201). Such workings should be seen against the massive development of the ironstone quarries on the north side of the river and research issues are discussed there (RAZ 11.41.2).Although the area to the north of the road from Bargate to Canwick had been subject to private enclosure since the 15th century (The Bargate Closes - RAZ 10.8.4), east of the Stamp End causeway and Canwick Road, and north of the road to Washingborough, was a zone of rich un-enclosed meadow land known in its western part as Cowpaddle and in the eastern part as Canwick Oxpasture, both of which were still marked as common land on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map (Mills 2001b). North of the pasture was the wetland, still subject to seasonal flooding even after the river had been canalised, called Canwick Ings.The boundaries of the newly defined areas of common will be of interest, as the vigour with which the boundaries were maintained might be seen as an index of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s continuing involvement in agriculture. It is probable that there were a number of light-weight structures connected with the pasture, herders' shelters and feeding stations for example, and any information about these will be of interest.",Summary,"The RAZ includes the South Common as mapped on the 1st edition O.S., and the common land to the east of the modern Canwick Road and north of Washingborough Road.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.16,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.16,

4e8c9324-03af-4a13-bea6-69bb7b4fd377,LARA RAZ AREA,,"Working-class housing estates c.1850-1945 in Newport, Newland, Butwerk Wigford and elsewhere","Starting in the 1850s the housing situation in the city improved dramatically and there can be little doubt that the improvements were stimulated by the establishment and growth of the major engineering works. The result was the plantation of large estates of good-quality brick-built terraced housing (using materials brought to the city by railway), of the type found across the Midlands. The main areas covered by such housing were the areas between Canwick Road and Wigford, the large areas (partly behind the existing street fronts) in southern Wigford and beyond, on the west side of Newark Road. In Newland a large area west of Rudgard Lane was laid out in housing of this type and an even larger area was established to the east of Rosemary Lane in Butwerk eventually extending all the way to Allenby Road. To the north-west of the upper city a large area of formerly agricultural land was laid out between Burton Road and Newport, which butted up against, and must have contrasted with, the still very rural area of Newport. The architectural details of the houses are all different, with many minor distinctions, all of which carried great social significance at the time they were built. These distinctions are enormously informative regarding the sociology of the late Victorian city and the research themes have been well described and illustrated by Chapman 1971; Aspinall 1978; Muthesius 1982 (which contains an excellent bibliography). Future work on the new estates in Lincoln can be compared with the study of the development of similar housing in Cleethorpes in Aspinall 1976 and in West Yorkshire (Caffyn 1986). Below ground, these areas of housing will show the development of sanitation (and particularly its improvement since the early 19th century), with the gradual introduction of drinking water and sanitation and, later, of electricity, gas and telephone.",Summary,"The RAZ is in many parts, the locations of which are marked on the 1st edition O.S. and on Wright‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of the development of Lincoln and are accounted for by those areas developed by 1905 which were not occupied by industrial plants of various types (Wright 1982, fig.20).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.26,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.26,

In 1874 ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáan apology for a bath‰Û¡ÌÝå» was opened between Fossdyke and the Racecourse but it was not popular and was too far away. Even so this early site is likely to be of some interest. Was it really as crude and unhygienic as was claimed, for example, and were the campaigners right to continue pressing for a better site? The issue became highly contentious as the expenditure of Council funds on such a scheme was questioned and it was not until 1908 that a fully equipped, though still open-air, bath complex was provided on the Witham bank north-east of Boultham, near the water-treatment works (Boultham Baths). At about the same time a small public baths was formed within part of the former open-air reservoir north of the Water Tower in Chapel Lane. There were also private baths of various types, including The Lindum Swimming Bath, 30 Lindum Road, the Public Baths at the corner of 97 Monks Road and Baggholme Road and Dominico Alfred D'Ascanio's Hydropathic Bath at 47 Tentercroft Street. These last three appear to be fascinating examples of local luxury and possibly other services. These sites offer archaeological potential for understanding better the social mores of Edwardian society. We can learn about the segregation of society by both class and sex from such sites as well as place the Lincoln baths within the spectrum of technical sophistication amongst sites of this type nationally.",Summary,The RAZ components are mapped following the boundaries depicted on various O.S. map editions and includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.79,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.79,

The burial ground continued in use, however, and apparently a bell was mounted in a brick arch to be tolled at funerals (Venables 1887-8b, 345). This scandalous state of affairs was an early target of the new militant Anglicanism and in 1839-40 a new church was built on a new site further north along Newport (RAZ 11.92.7). The present churchyard boundary wall was maintained during this period, and although made partly of reused medieval masonry much of the fabric is of 18th- or early 19th-century date. Repairs to it should be accompanied by an appropriate level of archaeological recording. Burials from this graveyard (made down to the 1850s) will be particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered a deterioration in their circumstances. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city. Many graveyard memorials of the Industrial Era survive and it is important that the inscriptions they carry are recorded before they become illegible.",Summary,The extent of the RAZ is defined by the graveyard mapped on the 1st edition O.S. map.

Several 19th-century elements are visible in the current townscape including the Pike Drain, a gravel-pit boundary line and several field boundaries and a footpath. There is a good sense of enclosure from the continuous building line, small gaps between buildings, constant building height and public/private boundary height, although this breaks down at the eastern end of De Wint Avenue where there are larger setbacks and plots, and buildings are not built across the full or near full plot width. Housing throughout the Character Area is two-storey semi-detached and mainly in red or brown brick. The main variations in architectural style are the roofs, with hipped, gabled and mansard styles. Streets are wide with carriageways, 2m-wide grass verges, wide footways and deep front gardens. Ancaster is a quiet, inward looking Character Area with limited connections to surrounding localities to the north, south and east although there is a reasonable connection on to Moorland Avenue.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 107,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,99,

The building has been added to and altered subsequently, but it retains much original fabric, which must be carefully recorded during repairs. Several recent building recording projects have shown that even tack-holes left by hangings can provide important evidence for the original layout of such buildings, and from techniques such as these it should be possible to understand the way in which elaborate social interactions in the Assembly Rooms were managed. Each different space will have been carefully fitted and decorated to indicate the relative social status of the occupants, and future work should aim at elucidating this elaborate pattern of social spaces. Although they arose from very similar social circumstances, any differences in function between the use of County Assembly Rooms compared with the City Assembly Rooms (RAZ 10.46.4, RAZ 11.71) will be of great interest as the distinction between the two social groups is not well understood. The RAZ includes the whole of the plot on which the Assembly Rooms stands, on the grounds that the buried remains of ancillary structures (kitchens etc.) are likely to cast light on the uses of the building itself.",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the boundaries depicted on the 1887 O.S. map editions and includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.7,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.7,
5163766d-4a2a-4ada-ae4e-6690fede103e,LARA RAZ AREA,,Woodlands and wood-pasture to the south west,"As in previous Eras (RAZ 5.9.2, 6.23, 7.3, 8.4, 9.6), the woodlands to the south-west of the city were an important economic resource for the city as well as for the parish of Boultham in which they lay. The woods may have continued in use for pannage, although there is little positive evidence for the practice. Any archaeological remains of pig farming will be more evident in the village of Boultham (RAZ 10.11) rather than in the woodland itself. Nevertheless we do need to characterise the woodland management regime in the Early Modern Era through extensive paleo-botanical sampling, particularly in the areas adjacent to wetlands. The woods, presumably pollarded or coppiced, were probably not only used as woodland pasture. They may also have produced several other products which were important for the city: fire-wood, timber for construction, charcoal and bark for tanning. The latter would be of particular importance, and it may be that the tanneries were located in the southern part of Wigford (RAZ 10.34) in order to be close to supplies of this important raw material. Certainly Dr Vince has shown (chapter 9a) that there were a number of tanners established in Wigford in the later medieval period. With the collapse of the cloth trade in the city, the bracken, which we have suggested may have been grown on Boultham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s poor soils as a source of potash (RAZ 9.6), would have become less important. Even so, it would still be useful for bedding litter and household fuel and it may even have continued in use as a mordant in the domestic-scale cloth production in the city. An effort to document the development of bracken cover in these woodland areas, therefore, may be usefully linked with the collapse of industrial scale cloth production in the city. Charcoal burning may have continued, although the archaeological remains of such woodland industries are likely to be fragile, and will consist of a variety of hearths and other structures. Although unspectacular, if such features can be detected they will be of considerable interest. The northern edge of the woodland area is likely to have been used for peat cutting and the changing shapes of the various pools to the north over time might be due to the impact of this activity. This industry is also little known in England, although peat must have played an important part in firing many domestic and industrial hearths (Grieg 1988, 124). Peat is known, for example, to have been used to fire the pottery kilns at Toynton All Saints (Cherry 1991b, 203) and in 1540 Edward Dawson was condemned in 1540 for having replaced a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácross-house‰Û¡ÌÝå» (presumably of timber framed construction) with one of turf - showing not only that building quality in the city had slipped, but that locally cut turf was being exploited (Hill 1956, 19).A sector of the land between west of the River Witham and the Fosse Way was in Hykeham parish.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the modern city boundary on the south and east. In the south-east, the Newark Road (Fosse Way) has been selected as a likely boundary between the woodland to the north and the river valley towards Bracebridge to the east, which is more likely to have been managed pasture or meadow land. The northern boundary of the RAZ is drawn along the line of peat formation which marks the edge of the former wetland.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.6,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.6,

51abb011-067e-43f9-a42d-aa59a941a7f3,LARA RAZ AREA,,Wetlands,"The documentary evidence suggests that the wetlands in the valley bottom continued to be of importance to the city economy in the Early Modern Era. The fish and fowl collected here is likely to have been of some importance in the citizens‰Û¡ÌÝå» diet; furthermore, the fact that the city frequently gave river fish and fowl as presents to visiting dignitaries suggests that these products were seen to be a local speciality (see for example the gift of 12 each of pike, tench and bream to Edward IV in 1461 - Hill 1948, 281). The Brayford wetlands provide an environment in which the remains of fish- and eel-weirs, traps and baskets will be preserved and it may be possible to investigate whether, with the fall in population in the 14th century, the scale of the fishery declined. Archaeo-zoological evidence indicates that sea fish probably replaced river fish in the diet as the middle ages went on (Chapter 10a), and this may imply that fishing became less intensive in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s wetlands as time went on. Whether less intensive or not, we do know that like so many aspects of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s life, what had been communal fishing rights became a private perquisite of the elite. In 1721 we find the first of several leases by the City Council of exclusive fishing rights to certain aldermen. The first only related to fishing rights between High Bridge and Thornbridge, but shortly afterwards similar leases were let for the fishing and fowling in Brayford as well (ed. Birch 1906, 29, Nos. 172, 179; 35-6, No.191). We know that water fowl also played an important part in the diet and the Brayford wetlands will have been important for this activity also. The Old Decoy marked on early maps (e.g. OS of 1824) lies in the modern Skellingthorpe parish, but it probably supplied Lincoln. Nevertheless it is possible that some of the other pools in the wetlands (Cuckoo Pool and Swanpool or their predecessors?) have their origins in decoys. When mapped in 1779 they both have extensions which might have had their origins in the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápipes‰Û¡ÌÝå» needed for a true decoy (of the type introduced from Holland in the 16th or 17th centuries) to function. We have too little information about the percentage of fowl in the diet to understand whether the exploitation of the Brayford wetlands fluctuated. In addition to these wetland industries the anaerobic conditions prevailing here mean that the Brayford and its associated wetlands will preserve important archaeo-botanical information, from which a complete environmental history of the area during the medieval period can be produced. Similarly, rare and important artefacts of wood, leather and other organic materials may be preserved, and any works on the riverbed must be fully sieved under archaeological supervision. Previous finds in the wetland have included the valuable and important hoards of early metalwork in the vicinity of the Stamp End causeway and further finds of this type should be expected.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include all the land below the 5m contour.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.7,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.7,

51f5de85-d226-48f6-874f-792a9145d30b,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Monks Road to Winn Street Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌMonks Road forms the northern boundary of the Character Area although the boundary widens to take in the buildings of Monks Abbey County Primary School. Montague Street and Tempest Street form the western and eastern boundaries respectively. To the south the boundary is formed by Winn Street, the rear plot boundaries of the properties between Napier Street and Ashfield Street and then by the railway line. The area includes the streets between Montague Street and Coleby Street, Ashfield Street, Eastfield Street, Percy Street, the north side of Winn Street and the south side of Monks Road. Monks Road/Winn Street is a townscape of Late Victorian/Edwardian red-brick terraced housing. The mainly two-storey houses have little or no setback from the footway, which gives a strong sense of enclosure on the streets. Decorative details on buildings vary and mainly consist of moulded brickwork at eaves level and heavy stone lintels. The medieval street pattern and later field boundaries can still be traced in parts of the Character Area, which has a strong grid-iron street pattern and regular block structure with regular plot sizes. The houses have a vertical emphasis with narrow fronts and tall windows; however, the repeated pattern of houses along the terrace gives a horizontal emphasis to the area.Within the broad style of terraced housing is a variety of building types, for example along Florence Street and Winn Street. Elements of the Victorian/Edwardian civic infrastructure survive such as Monks Abbey County Primary School, Monks Road Congregational Church, All Saints Church and Croft Street Primitive Methodist Chapel. Monks Road is a busy main road, which sees high volumes of traffic throughout the day, contrasting with the residential side streets, which are much quieter. The exception to this is Winn Street, which is often used as an alternative to Monks Road, particularly by westbound traffic. There are strong links to surrounding localities to the north and east although access to the north is impeded by traffic along Monks Road.

The institution seems to have started life as a Cell of Bardney Abbey and to have become a hospital by the 14th century. It was mentioned in 1401 (Cameron 1985, 129) and is probably represented by the entry of lands worth Ì´å£2.3/-4d in Hartsholme belonging to Bardney at the Dissolution (ed. Caley et al. 1817, 642).The decline of this obscure quasi-monastic site is potentially of the greatest interest. The late medieval institution is of considerable rarity as a type and, even if it turns out to have dwindled away ignominiously to an ordinary farm, that process has rarely been properly documented archaeologically. The quality and importance of the site means that archaeological work here will need to be on a large scale. This type of site is hard to understand in small holes and a major area excavation will be necessary to achieve a proper understanding.",Summary,In recent times it has been suggested that the institution occupied the identified site called Haw Hill (Hockley 1992).

There are almost no other late Medieval references to the church except for a second reference to an anchorite in 1502 (Venables 1887-8, 336) suggesting that the church may have become little more than a cell by this time.

Although it was never a very large church, there were late medieval additions to the fabric, in particular a north-east chapel, with a flat lead roof (shown in the painting by Moses Griffiths of c.1780) of the Early Modern Era and representing late medieval investment, probably as part of a mortuary bequest and comparable to the surviving chapel at St Mary-le-Wigford and that excavated at St Mark's. As the church survived the Reformation it will retain archaeological evidence for the changes in ritual practices made during the 16th century and it may be possible to assess any iconoclastic damage caused here during the Interregnum similar to that documented in other parts of the Close.The church will also retain evidence for liturgical reorganisations undertaken during the 17th and 18th centuries, which will be valuable in assessing the doctrinal stance of the Close population. As it was in use for at least 800 years, the burial ground will contain an important population for the assessment of the city's population, and the deposit should be treated as a single group if possible.",Summary,"The location of the cemetery is known and was open for use until the 19th century.

Pugin, whose father (A.C. Pugin) had spent a lot of time in Lincoln with E.J. Willson. The design of the individual houses (probably not completed until the 1860s) is intended to express the nature of 19th-century charity and its dependence on medieval precedent. The chapel (designed by Butterfield 1853-4) is an important expression of the same pious, medievalizing impulses. All repair and restoration work in the complex should be accompanied by archaeological recording aimed at elucidating the original layout of the buildings and explaining their fittings. In particular we should be interested in the doctrinal orientation expressed in the building. The founder was an extraordinary figure whose influence stretched well beyond the city (Hill 1974, 175). Although he started his career in the church as an evangelical with a genuine and radical concern for the poor of the newly industrialised city, he converted to Rome in 1841, well before the high-tide of Tractarianism, but then reverted to Anglicanism before Newman went to Rome in 1845. Even so he ended his days as a Roman Catholic and the almshouses, and especially perhaps the chapel layout and fittings, are likely to cast further light on his complex and influential religious beliefs.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include the whole site of the almshouses, which are contained within a tall boundary wall.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.9,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.9,

Development units dating to the late Post-war [1946-1967 AD] and Modern [1968-2008 AD] period illustrate changing attitudes and approaches, in particular the move towards more personalised and individual houses, in the construction of private residential housing estates in the mid to latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st century.Private residential developments, which continue to be built in the south of the area, have overwritten much of the former landscape. However, the townscape contains many traces of its rural past, including the lines of field boundaries associated with the 18/19th century enclosure of land, boundaries of two probable 19th century woodland plantations, and the 18/19th century remains of a former fishpond and a mill pond belonging to a now demolished farm complex. Earlier features include the Skellingthorpe and Doddington medieval roads.The form and style of residential properties varies throughout the Character Area, but is generally highly coherent within development units, except within the most recent residential estates. Despite variation between development units, many aspects of the townscape are strongly coherent in character. There is a medium to high density of residential housing, the majority of which consist of semi-detached or detached bungalows or two storey properties. Properties are arranged broadly parallel to streets, which form an irregular and sinuous pattern of cul-de-sacs and closes.Urban blocks are large and irregular in shape, which frequently extend along impermeable boundaries. Movement across the area is restricted to larger through roads, as access to development units is mostly confined to unconnected branches of cul-de-sacs and closes. Pedestrian paths provide good access between development units and through to neighbouring Character Areas Although well maintained, paths run to the rear of houses, and are often bordered by high garden fencing giving a feeling of enclosure and lack of security. In addition the direction and destination of many paths are unclear.Houses face the road, and are built in the centre/front of plots and are mostly set back 5-10m from the footway with private driveways and gardens. Public/private boundaries to the front of properties are frequently indistinct. Houses have active front facades and medium to high solid to void ratios with regular horizontal windows. Properties are generally plain in appearance and are built of brick and other small-scale materials. Roofs are mostly pitched, gabled, roofs with concrete tiles. Large and often poorly delineated set backs, low building height, medium to high building density, and wide residential roads combine to produce an open sense of enclosure and a horizontal emphasis throughout much of the Character Area.Modern developments show greater diversity in character, and contrast with earlier more uniform developments. The layout of streets and properties, and the form, size and decoration of buildings is more variable in recent developments, illustrating a move by modern developers to design and construct more individual properties from the outset. Higher building density, and the use of common architectural components, materials, and fixtures and fittings in development units demonstrates the economies of scale of mass residential estates, and their construction with a restricted set of building materials.Roads are surfaced with tarmac, and form an irregular and sinuous pattern of cul-de-sacs and closes, which are mostly 2 lanes in width, except for wider connecting through roadsPublic and open space in the Character Area is limited to residential streets, areas of open grassland, school fields, verges and mixture of unmanaged woodland and grassland in the south. Two ponds surrounded by private residential developments in the north of the area are designated as a local wildlife siteThe Character Area lacks any formal public space, and instead relies on the Birchwood Centre in Birchwood Character Area. Public buildings are few, and include three schools in the south of the area, and the Wildlife Public House and petrol station along Birchwood Avenue in the north.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 108,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,90,

56553b11-9460-4e49-ac4d-cb115a1f1950,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Peter-at-Pleas and St Peter-at-Arches,"There is some circumstantial evidence that the church site represented in the High Middle Ages by the two St Peters originated in an important pre-Viking church site. According to a reference in the Croxton Chartulary (Belvoir Castle Add Mss. 70-1)), by the 11th century this site consisted of two churches in the same churchyard; the southern dedicated to St Peter at Arches (so called because its proximity to the Stonebow) and the northern dedicated to St Peter at Pleas or ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáat Moot stone‰Û¡ÌÝå» (because of its proximity to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s meeting place). The soubriquets of the two churches indicates that, from at least the 11th century the churches played an important role in the government of the city - and the civic character of the site was retained until the demolition of St Peter-at-Arches in 1933 (RAZ 11.91.14). Regardless of its potential origin in a monastic pre-Viking church, it is this civic thread which will provide the most fruitful area for research in the High Medieval Era and it is possible that St Peter-at-Pleas (at any rate) owes its origin to the moot stone nearby. The moot stone itself, the meeting place of the burghwarmoot (Hill 1948, 187, 363) is perhaps to be found in its churchyard and, as the archaeology of such sites is quite rare, locating it should be an important task in future work. The process by which a potentially pre-Viking site might be transformed into the church associated with a meeting place will demonstrate in a very clear manner the disjunction between the pre-Viking ruling elite and that inaugurated by the Viking settlement. The apparent ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácivic‰Û¡ÌÝå» use of the churches, however, did not prevent them being privately owned (St Peter-at-Pleas possibly by Earl Morcar - Hill 1948, 41n - and St Peter-at-Arches perhaps by Tochi - Hill 1948, 132). When St Peter-at-Arches was demolished in 1933 many fragment of 12th-century sculpture were discovered. Although it is not certain that these originated on the site, it is possible that research into them would give us some idea of the church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s appearance at this date (RAZ 10.60.44; RAZ 11.91.14; RAZ 11.92.4)In both cases we should expect this civic patronage to have effects in the ritual layout of the churches and we might expect subsidiary chapels. The will of William Tucker of 1506 mentions the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácross aisle‰Û¡ÌÝå» which suggests that St Peter-at-Pleas church had a transept - a feature we only know elsewhere in Lincoln at St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (ed. Foster 1914, 30). The same patronage will have also resulted in the accumulation of a group of elite burials and the distribution of these within the cemetery will be of great interest. Do they focus on one of the two churches or are they evenly distributed? Did the moot stone itself attract or repel burials, and, if it did, were they of high status?",Summary,The RAZ boundary follows that of the former graveyard which is known from early mapping.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.44,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.44,

56a24f75-a12c-461e-bc67-28412fe5cd42,LARA RAZ AREA,,Roads entering the city,"All of the major roads entering Lindum colonia are thought to have been established in the Military Era (RAZ 6.21). Complete sections across such roads, from the base of deposits up to modern road surfaces, will be particularly valuable in locating periods of intensive activity, when road surfaces are repaired frequently, and those when less vehicular activity results in more modest repairs. Occasionally new roads may be laid out or may disappear and such events will be valuable in understanding the changing functions of the various parts of the city. Particularly helpful will be any signs of an interim period (perhaps with little road repair) at the start of the colonia period, which might suggest a phase of uncertainty or indecision regarding the use to which the fortress was to be put following the departure of the Legions. Similarly dating evidence indicating when, precisely, the final repairs to road surfaces were made will be important in corroborating the evidence from other sources pointing towards continuing vigour in the city to the end of the 4th century. The length of road immediately south of the lower city, across the river course(s) and the Wigford causeway is likely to be specially rewarding for such research into the development of the Roman city. We remain unclear how Ermine Street was carried across the river channel(s), though a timber bridge (or bridges) is likely. Such a bridge would be an extremely valuable discovery as a monument enabling understanding of engineering techniques etc., but we can also hope that it will enable us to date various repairs through dendrochronology and, therefore, obtain an accurate picture of fluctuations in traffic accessing the city. The timber remains of such bridges, or indeed of fords, will be well-preserved here in the waterlogged conditions of RAZ 7.9. Several of the roads are known to link with other parts of the province‰Û¡ÌÝå»s road network, but some of Lindum‰Û¡ÌÝå»s supposed Roman roads may only extend for a short distance and have the specific aim of linking a known feature to the city. The two roads to the east of the city along the lines of Greetwellgate and Monks Road, for example, are not known east of the modern city boundary. This may suggest that they only extend as far as the boundary of the Greetwell Villa (RAZ 7.23) and the date of the road layout may be of great assistance in understanding the sequence of construction of that important complex. In addition to conveying traffic to and from the Greetwell Villa, these two roads also gave access to two suburbs (closer to the walls) and then to large cemeteries. Although no equivalent structure on the west side of the city is known, the road heading west along either the line of West Parade, or along the road leading from the lower west gate, also gave access (as far as we know) only to cemeteries. The road heading north-east from the fortress east gate (along the line of Nettleham Road) is also unknown in the landscape beyond Nettleham village. Indeed the alignment is lost about 3 km to the north-east where the road strikes the valley of Nettleham Beck. At this point Mr Everson has recorded the cropmark of a large barrow and other features, which might suggest a ritual focus of some sort, perhaps the temple of the Romanised Celtic god Mars Rigonemetos whose sanctuary is recorded in a fine dedicatory inscription from Nettleham (see also RAZ 7.17).",Summary,"These RAZs are all drawn to the same boundaries as their equivalents in the Military Era, with a 50m margin on either side of the known or extrapolated road lines.

There is strong unity in the townscape of post-modern style blocks of flats with small courtyards in between with repeated use of the same materials throughout the area. There is also a link with the rest of the university campus in terms of architectural style and materials. There are strong pedestrian links to the rest of the university campus and a good visual link across the Fossdyke to the rest of the city centre. The Fossdyke to the north, railway to the south and pedestrian-only access to the west act as strong boundaries to the area.

56cbfe59-4be1-4b63-88f5-88e71b8d49b5,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Birchwood Fringe Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌBirchwood Fringe Character Area is a large residential area mostly built within a short space of time between 1970 and 2000. The majority of the area lies between the Skellingthorpe and Doddington Roads, and forms part of the larger suburb of Birchwood located 3.5km south west of the centre of Lincoln. The character of the area is strongly influenced by natural and semi-natural features including a number of flooded gravel pits, wooded areas, and a prevalence of dispersed mature trees throughout.Influences of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s rural past are frequently found in the townscape, such has the line of former field boundaries associated with the enclosure of land subsequent to the Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century, and Stone‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Place nursing home which was the house of a large early 19th century farm complex possibly associated with the mid 19th century Hartsholme Estate. Eastern parts of Birchwood Fringe Character Area are strongly influenced by surviving woodland associated with the estate and later plantations, which is now a designated Country Park. The Character Area also borders and contains remains of the 18/19th century woodland plantations, and areas of former gravel extraction, which are now a series of lakes and ponds.The form and style of modern residential properties varies throughout the Character Area, but are generally coherent within development units, which often have a particular broad style, and contain common townscape characteristics. However, individual houses within development units are often distinguished from neighbouring properties by differing one or more building attributes. Variation within development units is more to do with form on earlier housing dating to the 1970‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, than on more recent houses, which appear more individual as a result of their varying decorative features.Although there is considerable variation between development units, the townscape has many common elements. The Character Area is divided into large irregular urban blocks, which frequently extend along impermeable boundaries. Development units are accessed by long branches of sinuous cul-de-sacs and closes, which generally inhibit access to adjacent development units and the wider area. Buildings are almost entirely 2 storey-detached houses or bungalows with gabled roofs with ridgelines mainly orientated parallel to the street. Houses are brick built and often incorporate other small to medium scale materials including cladding and tile. Properties are set back 5-10m from the footway, and are located in the centre of their plots facing the road. Public/private boundaries are generally poorly defined or non-existent, with lawned areas and private paved or tarmac driveways running up to the footpath. Building frontages have high solid to void ratios and generally appear active with regular uPVC casement windows and doorways on the front faÌÎå_ade. Properties are built around a curvilinear/sinuous network of roads and are frequently arranged in small cul-de-sacs and closes. Overall building density is medium to high giving a good sense of enclosure for a suburb, which is heightened by frequent trees and the view of treetops above rooflines. Building lines are often stepped, and broadly follow the line of roads. However, on earlier properties building lines appear more continuous compared to more recent properties, which tend to be arranged in more fragmented and stepped building lines. Variations in building line and the angle by which building frontages address the street emphasises the aspect of individual properties and increases the privacy of individual houses.There are clear variations between earlier 1970‰Û¡ÌÝå»s housing, found mainly in the north of the Character Area, and more recent housing dating from the 1980‰Û¡ÌÝå»s onwards. The character of individual developments form a broad chronology, illustrating changing approaches towards the construction of residential estates during the Modern period, in particular with regard to the privacy and individuality of properties, and the integration of the car and garage into residential housing design. Windows on earlier properties are horizontal, and become increasingly vertical on more modern houses. Properties dating to the 1970‰Û¡ÌÝå»s are generally plainer, but show greater variety in form and scale within development units than more recent properties, which are made individual through decorative variations on their front faÌÎå_ades. Earlier properties tend to have their longer axes orientated parallel to the carriageway in comparison to more recent properties, which tend to have thinner plots and their narrow sides facing the road. Garages are more prominently located on properties dating to the 1970‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. There are also observable differences in the townscape towards the southwest compared to the northeast. Plots size and building scale are largest towards the north and east of the area, and broadly decrease in size towards the southwest. Housing density in the north and east is comparatively lower than in the southwest of the area, and the density of woodland becomes increasingly dispersed towards the southwest.Roads are surfaced with tarmac and are of two-car width. Roads connecting different development units are few, and are usually wider with denser vegetation and woodland along their verges. However, there is relatively good pedestrian access between development units and into rural/parkland areas to the north and east, although the direction and function of many pathways is unclear. Open space is limited, and mainly consists of undefined gardens to the front of properties. However, there are several large green/natural areas, including ponds and woodland.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 32,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,83,

The pumping station, which formerly existed north of the drain and south of the Wellington Works (Herridge 1999, No.5365), was probably part of this system in origin. Remains of this structure will survive below ground and should be included in studies of the water-management regimes of western Lincoln. Further west, the red brick building of c.1882, which housed the water-pumping engine at Boultham Junction (on the west side of the railway tracks at Boultham Junction) still stands, although roofless. Although full records are required of the building during conversion or demolition, archaeological research might concentrate on the foundations for the engines themselves. We need to understand where the engine provided at both of these fitted into the development of local pumping technology and provision. The sites' fuel supply network also needs identification. It is presumed that the engine of 1882 related to later stages of water control in The Holmes, and an important research aim should be to ask whether this engine replaced an earlier one, on this site or elsewhere.",Summary,The RAZ is restricted to the site of the engine houses and their compounds as mapped on the 1st edition O.S.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.4.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.4.3,

56f287b5-bcd4-4623-9e05-c5294481376d,LARA RAZ AREA,,Stonepits north and north-east of the upper city,"There is little sign that the area of quarrying through pits in the area between Eastgate and Newport, which has been identified in earlier Eras (RAZ 9.41.3 and 10.41.3) continued into the Industrial Era. If we were correct to identify this area, also, as an area where commoners‰Û¡ÌÝå» rights permitted individual diggings in the common fields, then it should come as no surprise that these rights were extinguished after enclosure in 1803. But, in fact, there seems to be little evidence that stone-digging had occurred here for some considerable time. Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1842 shows no quarrying in the area defined as RAZ 9.41.3/ RAZ 10.41.3, but it does show the slow expansion of housing on to the land behind Church Lane. Stonefield House was built in a large garden shortly before 1868 (Cameron 1985, 157) (RAZ 11.28) and must have occupied part of the land formerly used for stone digging. Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map does show, however, a new quarry west of Newport (north of the modern Vere Street) which may, in some sense, have taken over from the common diggings in the Stonefield area as supplier of stone in the northern parts of the city. This quarry looks like a small-scale establishment on the Padley map, and was clearly on private property, extending back from Newport itself. It also has two rows of what may be worker‰Û¡ÌÝå»s cottages for the quarry workers along its western boundary, Elvin's Cottages and Hartley's Pits . If they have been correctly identified as workers cottages associated with the quarry any remains will provide valuable evidence for the relative status of quarry workers, as compared with other groups of labourers, as well as much incidental information about their life-styles. The quarry was no longer active in 1889, although the workers‰Û¡ÌÝå» housing was still standing (1st edition OS.). This map also shows a pair of adjoining quarries south of Nettleham Road (near the modern Lee Road), which had not been shown on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map. Perhaps stone supply in this area had moved site once again. These Nettleham Road quarries also had a row of what are probably cottages for the workers associated along the roadside, and remains of these cottages will be of similar interest to those west of the Newport quarry. The cottages were known as Stonepit Houses in 1889, and some of them still stand. The fabric of these buildings needs to be recorded during the course of alterations with the aim of understanding the conditions in which the quarry workers originally lived. This quarry was associated with a ropewalk, a site type considered in RAZ 11.39. Apart from the interest of the workers‰Û¡ÌÝå» housing associated with these two quarries, we should be interested in the level of technology and mechanisation used to exploit the stone. Being relatively restricted ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápits‰Û¡ÌÝå» it is likely that they were only exploiting building stone, and future work on the sites should investigate whether the stone was being prepared on the site before being exported for use. There is no indication in the mapped evidence that these quarries were being exploited to feed limekilns, but future research work should accommodate this possibility. Research agendas for both such quarries and limekilns have been issued (LUAU 1996a; LUAU 1996b).",Summary,"The RAZ boundary maintains that established for 10.41.3, but with two outlying extensions around the edges of the quarries west of Newport and south of Nettleham Road.

56fea6f7-9352-4df9-a5cf-4345e7636183,LARA RAZ AREA,,Market place on Castle Hill,"A market was held on Saturday evenings under the auspices of the Duchy of Lancaster in the rectangular square which developed between the east gate of the Castle and Exchequer gate. There seems to be no record of its grant, but it was still in operation in the 19th century (Hill 1948, 101). There should be some documentation for the market surviving in the copious Duchy papers and these should be searched for documentary information. We can guess that it was founded in the 13th or 14th century as an attempt by the Duchy to capitalise on tolls on the goods brought to service the elite markets of the upper city. The market may have already been established in the mid 12th century, when, Dr Vince argues, the area outside the Castle east gate was redeveloped (chapter 9a). At this date, he argues, the whole of the space between the southern wall of the upper city, the new inner bailey of the Castle and the parish boundary of St Paul-in-the-Bail was probably open. If this is so, to the north of the modern Castle Hill, Nos. 1-10 Bailgate would have been encroachments on to the original space presumably made by the mid 13th century, to which date cellars in No 3 Bailgate and Nos 9-10 Bailgate are thought to belong (Jones et al. 1996, 56-81). There were also encroachments on to the King‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Highway to the south and south-east recorded in the Hundred Rolls; these encroachments left an area approximately the same size as the modern square open (Johnson and Vince 1992; Stocker and Vince 1997).",Summary,"The RAZ for the market includes the broad street itself, with the intention of managing deposits and structures related to the market itself.

576b0856-c0b5-4d50-be8f-ce89c22d2d7e,LARA RAZ AREA,,Beggarsholme market in Butwerk,"Dr Vince has explained that, before housing covered the area during the 11th and 12th centuries, it is likely that the western part of Butwerk was a large, open, fairground named ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáthe water meadow of the Hawkers‰Û¡ÌÝå», the Beggarsholme (Cameron 1985, 13) (chapter 9a). This is a point of very great importance to our understanding of the development of the city. This fairground, Dr Vince demonstrates, was not immediately outside the Clasketgate gate, which would put it into the same category as the market places at Newport, Eastgate and St Botoph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Green, but instead it was on open land, in the meadows north of the Stamp End causeway. Of course, this is precisely the area, in later periods, where the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s dock, the Blackdyke is known to have been located (RAZ 9.1, 9.2), and it is very tempting to suggest that the Beggersholme fair was located here to take advantage of an earlier period of dock than those for which we have documentation. Beggarsholme fair, then, could have developed as a dock-side market for early Lincoln dealing in material brought in by water from the east. It is possible that, by the 14th century, however, the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s interest in the fair here had become re-located downstream to Short Ferry or Dogdyke. A list of tolls claimed by the city on the sale of goods in 1316 shows that the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s income from Dogdyke was exceeded only by the fair at Newport (Hill 1948, 215). As such the markets or fairs at Dogdyke or Shortferry might be considered the 14th-century counterpart of the dock-side markets which we suggest may have existed at Beggarsholme at earlier dates in the High Medieval Era, which dealt with goods arriving by water from the west and south. The question to be addressed by archaeological study, especially perhaps through pottery studies at both sites, is whether the commercial activity moved from Butwerk to Dogdyke and Short Ferry (perhaps in the 11th century), or whether the two commercial centres operated independently and were unrelated.The close proximity of the proposed early fair at Beggarsholme to the possible early church site at Monks' Abbey (RAZ 9.55) is also of very great interest. The association between early monastic sites and the establishment of early markets has often been remarked upon (eg, Sawyer 1981; Ulmschneider 2000, chapter 6) and, on the face of it, this would seem to be another example of a major pre-Conquest fair held at the gates of a suspected monastic site. Unfortunately, as the area was re-developed in the 11th and 12th centuries it is not possible to pinpoint the location of the Beggarsholme fair ground, as is possible for some of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s other markets. Consequently a large RAZ is proposed covering the later quaysides, dock, monastic closes and suburban houses. Excavations at any of these might be lucky enough to find crucial evidence relating to the fair. From the 11th or 12th century onwards, it is likely that the commercial functions of the fair were conducted on the quaysides themselves (RAZ 9.2). It is important that this early fair is not confused with St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Fair (see RAZ 10.18 below). The latter fair (which was held between 17th November-2nd December on St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Closes east of St Peter ad Fontem) was granted in 1409 (Hill 1948, 270). It may well have represented an attempt to revive both the tradition of the Beggarsholme fair and, perhaps, the trade-routes along the Witham with which it was, perhaps, associated. There may be some connection between St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Fair and the Swine Market held at the bottom of the hill, near the site of St Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church, but the earliest record of this market is in 1711 (Hill 1966, 143; Cameron 1985, 42).",Summary,"As we have no indication where the fair ground was located, the RAZ includes the entire area of the known suburb, bounded by the river to the south, the city wall to the west and the foot of the scarp slope to the north. To the east the boundary of the later suburb of Butwerk has been followed, but there is absolutely no reason why the market cannot have extended further east, especially if it was originally under the auspices of a monastic site which was the predecessor of Monks' Abbey.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.18,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.18,

578cad27-c273-462f-9fc4-12bc1930b5d2,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Martin (original site),"St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish, like St Swithin's, saw a great increase in its population from the mid 18th century onwards, and eventually a new church was built on a new site (RAZ 11.92.5). The medieval church, with its new tower (of 1740), served this expanding population (RAZ 9.60.38; 10.60.38), and in 1809 it was enlarged, probably through the reconstruction of a new north aisle on the foundations of an aisle of 13th-century date, to designs by William Hayward (Hill 1966, 298). No doubt, as an important city church, the layout and fittings of the church were reorganised in recognition of new doctrinal positions held in the parish and some of these will be accessible to excavation. In 1873, however, it was decided that a new church was needed, both to cater for the increasing population and also to move the centre of the parish closer to its new centre of population in Newland (RAZ 11.92.5). The fine west tower of the old church survived as a landmark, however, and was maintained as a monument until 1921. With its potentially early population, St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churchyard will preserve an important group of burials and, as it continued in use for burial until the 1850s, it must preserve one of the longest sequences of burials in the city. It is a site, then, which offers the prospect of understanding the development of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s physical anthropology through a very long period of time. Burials from this graveyard will be particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered a deterioration in their circumstances. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city.

57c0d532-425a-4e84-be8e-7cccb9ae544b,LARA RAZ AREA,,Ditched boundaries to west (and north?) of the city,"The complex ditched boundary to the east and north-east of the city, known from aerial survey and partial excavations, is an important monument for our understanding and appreciation of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s heritage, even though only a very small length of it is within the city boundary. This boundary feature is at present the principal feature defining the character of the northern hilltop in the Iron Age. Until recently such multiple boundaries have been thought of a defensive structures, and indeed the similar ditch systems at Camulodunum are still viewed in this way (Crummy 1997, 9-17). Even so, Richard Bradley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work on the Chichester ditch systems strongly suggests that these complex boundaries were primarily symbolic (1971). Future excavation here, therefore, should focus on this issue; are military explanations really satisfactory to explain the archaeology or will only explanations of the features as primarily symbolic boundaries account for their complexity and their length of life? Within the boundaries of this RAZ, under the Roman road (Wragby Road), there may be an original entry through the ditch system. Obviously such entries offer the prospect of greatly enhancing our understanding of the ditch system itself, but even so the City Archaeologist should take the lead in co-ordinating study of the whole of the Ditch system, outside the Local Authority‰Û¡ÌÝå»s area, in West Lindsey District. As has been pointed out above, the recent study by Boutwood (1998) has demonstrated that the north-south boundary ditch (of which the triple ditch in RAZ 5.6 forms part) was joined at various points by east-west ditches across the Lincoln Edge, dividing the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhigh‰Û¡ÌÝå» land up into zones. In particular we need to know where the first such transverse boundary north of Lincoln lies. It is unlikely to be as far north as Hemswell (the most southerly reported by Boutwood), whilst May (1984) located it in the vicinity of Brattleby and Hackthorn. When searching for this east-west boundary, we should not forget, however, that the boundary could have been provided by a natural feature, and in this respect the transverse valley, in which the modern village of Riseholme stands, provides a marked topographical feature which might deserve further attention. When this transverse boundary is discovered it will define the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáterritory‰Û¡ÌÝå» of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácentral place‰Û¡ÌÝå» at Lincoln and its discovery is an urgent priority, through air photography or other means. As already discussed in chapter 5a, these elaborate ditched boundaries give the site of Lincoln one of the characteristics attributed to oppida. But we have seen that this word needs to be used carefully and, although the question of whether pre-Roman Lincoln should be called an oppidum needs to be kept in mind, the presence of ditch systems on their own may be an inadequate basis for the description.",Summary,"The east, north and south boundaries follow the city limits.

The large rectangular plot was dominated by a large two-storey building with sparse neo-classical detailing and a heavy pediment, shown in plan on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1819 map, set within a compound containing other buildings. It was an arsenal intended for storing arms and other military supplies with which to arm the city in case of invasion. The building was made redundant by the creation of militia barracks in the 1850s (RAZ 11.82) and it appears to have been sold to Dawber‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Brewery (RAZ 11.38). Early photographs show that the brewery incorporated the depot buildings into their new site (Elvin 1976, 12). This is a relatively unusual site. Such depots are little known to archaeology, but it is surprising how relatively low a priority security seems to have been in the design of the Lincoln compound, as there was little perimeter defence, even though the central building was evidently secure. This issue can be addressed through selective excavation on the perimeter, but we also need to know how the complex functioned as a unit. Presumably the impressive building served as a secure store, but what were the other buildings for? Was there any resident garrison, and if so, what were their living and working conditions?",Summary,The RAZ is bounded by the limits of the complex defined on the Padley 1819 map.

59b7e8b9-0cb8-4256-afce-ddaca914f15b,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Butwerk suburb,"A single excavation in Butwerk (BE73), right on the western boundary of the suburb, investigated the sequence and character of domestic occupation here. Occupation began early, probably in the late 10th century and, therefore, earlier than in any of the other city suburbs apart from Wigford. Far from being a sign that the walled city was already full by this date, however, domestic and commercial occupation here in the 10th century is probably a reflection of the pivotal role the Butwerk suburb played in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s commercial trade by water. Consequently, evidence for the combination of domestic and commercial activity should be looked for in future work on these sites (cf. RAZ 9.40). The suburb also has slightly more complete documentation than many of the other suburbs and, consequently, we can gain important insights into its chronological development. This is the only suburb in Lincoln (and one of very few in England) where Domesday Book records its development - Dr Vince has shown that Colswein‰Û¡ÌÝå»s land, on which he built 36 houses and two churches between 1066 and 1086, is likely to be a strip of newly occupied land along the eastern side of the suburb, in the area between Montague Street and John Street (chapter 9a). This single item of documentation makes this area a priority for archaeological investigation, because of the prospect offered of precision dating of stratigraphy and finds. Excavation here would also enable us, for the first time perhaps, to see a post-Conquest landlord maximise his income from his holdings - how large were the newly built tenements to be? How many people did Colswein envisage bringing in from the surrounding countryside? What types of people?An additional level of importance in Butwerk is the presence of the extramural estate given to St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey of York by Romfar prior to 1115-19. The Monks' Abbey estate itself forms separate RAZs (RAZ 9.8.5, RAZ 9.55), but here we should note that this estate probably had a distinct centre, presumably somewhere in the vicinity of the later Cell buildings. An estate centre here would have been in a very similar location to the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s estate centre at Willingthorpe in Newland (RAZ 9.32.1) and they may have been quite similar institutions. Comparisons between the domestic and agricultural arrangements in both estate centres would be highly instructive. The Benedictines made the Black Monks estate an important source of income, and fought to keep it distinct from the city to the west, whereas the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s estate at Willingthorpe seems to have become engulfed within the city, and did not keep its separate identity. These different trajectories probably have their origin in the different agricultural and commercial uses to which the estate centres were put, and those differences should be visible archaeologically.At later dates, it is clear that the eastern part of Butwerk, like most other parts of the city, became depopulated. The timing and detail of the decline and retrenchment are of great interest. Dr Bischoff (1975) has shown that the collapse in the cloth trade occurred in the second half of the 13th century and, as the fortunes of Butwerk were closely related to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s commercial prosperity, we might expect the whole suburb simply to return to pasture. In the western part of the suburb, however, the house on Friar‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane (BE73) was greatly extended at this date, for example, whilst to the north, on the corner of modern Broadgate and Monks Road, a major house with a ground floor hall and cross-wing, was extensively rebuilt in the 14th century and survived until 1828 (Jones et. al, 1990, 141-2). Clearly then Butwerk was able to cope with economic fluctuation after a fashion (RAZ 10. 29). The 1Ì´_ burials found at BE73 are no longer thought to represent a churchyard.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the top of the cliff along the north side, as there is good evidence for settlement in the 12th and 13th centuries along the roads which lead directly up the hill (Holgate, Pottergate and St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane).

This appears to have been an early name for the street which ran along the outside of the south wall of the lower city, along the line now taken by Guildhall Street, although Dr Vince has argued that it also applied to the whole district south of the city wall (chapter 9a). Tenements along this street, certainly to the south, though possibly to the north also (once the city wall had been breached), are likely to incorporate baking equipment such as the bases of ovens etc. As one of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s few clearly documented artisanal areas the context in which the bread was being baked is also of interest. Were the bakeries domestic tenements, and, if so, was a shop provided on the street front? As the producers of one of the staples for the city, its population and economy ought to be reflected in the numbers of bakers in Baxtergate, although it may take some time for meaningful statistics on such issues to be collected. It is possible that Baxtergate originally extended east of Stonebow, as there is a reference to an oven in Saltergate in the 13th century (Hill 1948, 157). If it did prove to extend this far east, it would further emphasise how relatively unimportant the stretch of quayside east of the Stonebow was for waterborne traffic in the High Middle Ages. The evidence for medieval bakeries in England has not really been effectively synthesised and as we can identify the bakers' street in Lincoln, it offers an important case study for this industry in its context.",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries are intended to include the tenements along either side of the presumed Baxtergate, extending back to the presumed line of St Mary Stighe on the south side and the line of the presumed Lewinstighe (Mint Street) on the north.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.38,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.38,

At least we have no reason to think that this might have been an earlier, church set in an isolated position independently of the spread of the suburb along Langworthgate/Wragby Road. The church is first mentioned in 1163 (ed. Foster 1931 204-9 RA255) and we have no real information about how much earlier in date it might have been founded, although it is sometime said that St Giles, a provencal saint, was a dedication favoured by the Normans. Given that we suspect that the date of foundation might indicate the date at which the suburb reached this far out, however, its date of foundation is a matter of great interest. Probably it was a proprietary foundation and its foundation may mark the exploitation of a hitherto rural estate by a local landowner, by converting it into an urban one - as happened on the fringe of Butwerk at St Peter ad fontem in the period between 1066 and 1086 (RAZ 9.60.12). The exploration of the date and circumstances of its foundation should be a priority in future work. The archaeological evidence for the date and character of the transformation of the church into the chapel for the hospital in the 13th century will also be of considerable interest, as will any archaeological signs of its continuing parochial responsibilities within the framework of the hospital institution. Any transformation in the physical characteristics of the graveyard population which could be associated with this conversion from parochial to hospital use would be of interest, especially as we can make certain assumptions about the hospital inmates, based on our knowledge that they had all been minor clergy at the Cathedral.",Summary,"It is presumed that the parish church became the chapel of the hospital, in which case it seems likely that its ruins were those of the hospital chapel, which survived, on the south side of the hospital precinct alongside Wragby Road, into the 19th century. However, this has not been located precisely east to west and we have no evidence at all for the other three churchyard boundaries. Consequently it has been decided not to draw a separate RAZ for the parish church but to use the same boundary for both church and hospital RAZs.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.7,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.7,

5c189eaa-de9f-4650-b70d-0d62d021b222,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Hospital Plantation Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌHospital Plantation Character Area is an extensive area of semi-natural oak-birch woodland on the western boundary of the City. It includes areas of remnant heath land, planted pines, broad-leaved plantations, two ponds and several damper areas. It is made up of two sites, Hospital Plantation and Birchwood Nature Park. Up until the Early Industrial period [1750-1845 AD] this area was probably open heath land and typical heath species like bell heather and purple moor grass can still be found in several areas. On the eastern side of the bypass there is a particularly good example of heath land habitat and this is one of only two sites in the City where it is known to occur.The land was probably enclosed during the Early Industrial period. Later woodland planting of the 19th/20th century occurred within field units, and as a result many of the edges of the Character Area correspond to the lines of field boundaries associated with the enclosure of the land in the Early Industrial period. Hospital Plantation would have been one of a number of plantations that existed in the surrounding area.During the Modern era [1968-2008] Hospital Plantation has been divided into several parts by the busy A46 that runs north/south right through its centre and the pre-existing B1190 that runs east/west through the southern end of the Character Area. Hospital Plantation is currently unmanaged, while Birchwood Nature Park is managed for nature conservation and recreation. The area is bounded to the west and north by agricultural land and to the east and south by Post-war Modern housing developments within Birchwood Estate Character Area. Access to the site is provided at a number of places including a lay-by on the A46, from the entrance to Birchwood Nature Park on Doddington Road and from several points within the housing development that adjoins the eastern boundary of the area.The topography of the Character Area is predominantly flat with a number of areas of hummocky ground in the eastern half of the site, which are associated with the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s former use as an airfield. Between 1941 and 1952 land to the east of the Character Area was used as a military airfield for heavy bombing aircraft. The wooded areas of the plantations were an important strategic component of the airfield, and a considerable amount of associated infrastructure remains, although much of it is hidden by subsequent growth. These include several small buildings that were used as ammunition stores and air raid shelters.Pedestrian footpaths of varied qualities criss-cross the area, including roads and paths laid as part of the military use of the site and compacted footpaths put down as part of the development of Birchwood Nature Park. Within the site there are a limited number of open spaces. This means that views are generally short and predominantly of woodland. The housing areas adjacent to the site have views onto the woodland edge, though this is usually from the rear of the properties. The trees largely shield the view of the A46 from neighbouring Character Areas and give the impression of green space extending out from the City into the agricultural land beyond. To some extent the woodland also functions as an acoustic barrier.Birchwood Nature Park is used for informal recreation such as walking dogs and playing. The open area of dry grassland could be used for ball games. Hospital Plantation is regularly used for informal motorbike scrambling and as place for young people to gather. At times this causes disturbance to neighbouring properties and has resulted in damage to some areas of woodland. There is evidence of people using the site to take drugs and drink alcohol, as well as fires and fly tipping.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 89,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,80,

5ce726d8-51a9-4be5-801f-6141e4c48ce6,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Peter ad Fontem,"This church is particularly important because Sir Francis Hill showed that it was very probably one of the two churches erected by Colswein on his newly developed urban estate between 1066 and 1086 (1948, 133, 161). Such precise dating for the foundation of urban churches is extremely rare (these two cases are the only ones in Lincoln - but they are rare anywhere). And it is even more important because we know not just the date but also the circumstances in which the church was founded. Colswein was converting hitherto agricultural land into land on which he would settle tenants. It is a combination of a planned suburb and a planned industrial estate of the third quarter of the 11th century. Presumably, as a good landlord Colswein saw it as his responsibility to also provide for the spiritual well being of his tenants and so equipped the new suburb with two churches. Although that is not to say that the spring (fontem) was not already a focus of some devotion, possibly even with an accompanying chapel. The possibility that the 11th-century church was sited respecting an early focus of devotion merely adds to the interest and significance of this site. The 11th-century documentation is critical, however, and its survival makes the archaeological exploration of St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s a matter of very great sensitivity and importance. Small apertures into the archaeology may not be enough to extract the potential of this site. As it has such a precise date of origin and context the whole graveyard population needs to be studied as a single group and should be either preserved or excavated in toto. Similarly the church fabric, in its early phases at least, needs to be understood as a totality and not in small pieces.",Summary,"Unfortunately the site of the churchyard is only approximately located from discoveries made during building work in 1857. It was clearly bounded on the north by Monks Road and it lay east of Rosemary Lane, but the original account does not reported precisely where (Lincoln City Library Ms., Ross Annales 3 p.112). Writing thirty years later Venables (1887-8b, 335-6) declared that the discoveries had been made between the overflow burial ground for St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and Monks Road and it is here that we have located the RAZ. Venables states that the southern boundary of the churchyard was adjoined by the northern boundary of the new St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s cemetery, which implies a very large churchyard, but we have no evidence at all for its east boundary.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.12,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.12,

5db00382-aefd-4762-bf7b-7c69b6b70a63,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Hykeham Road West Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌHykeham Road West Residential Character Area is a small suburban area lying approximately 5km south of Lincoln city centre, and is composed of two small/medium residential developments dating to the Post-war [1946-1966 AD] period and St. Christopher‰Û¡ÌÝå»s School. Many aspects of the townscape are strongly coherent across the whole Character Area. Residential development has overwritten much of the former rural landscape, however some traces of earlier activity remain evident such as Newark Road which marks the approximate route of the Roman ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáFosseway‰Û¡ÌÝå» and the route of Hykeham Road which originates from the High Medieval period. Street names such as Gregg Hall Drive are associated with farms created during the Early Industrial period and the alignment of some field boundaries associated with the enclosure of land also survive in the current townscape. In the years following the Second World War residential housing developments were constructed in the area. The vast majority of the area consists of a medium/high density of residential housing arranged around a loose or strong grid pattern of cul-de-sacs and connecting roads with good access through each estate. Houses are generally 2/3 bays in width and are almost entirely semi-detached 2 storey buildings or detached bungalows. Building lines are strong, with a high density of closely spaced houses throughout the area. Properties face the road and are built with a 4-10m setback to allow for private driveways and gardens. The austerity of the Post-war period is expressed in the plainness of the houses and the limited number of building materials used in the construction of properties. Simple decoration is mostly achieved through projections and rendering/cladding. The majority of houses have one or more projections to the front, including entire wings to the full height of the house, one/two storey bay windows, and single pitch porches or concrete hoods. Public/private boundaries most commonly take the form of a border of low brick walls and/or privet hedging. However, several properties have indistinct transitions between the footpath and the forecourt. Large set backs, low public/private boundaries, consistent building height, medium to high building density, and wide residential roads with verges contribute to an open sense of enclosure for a suburb. However, closely spaced detached properties and mature trees heightens the sense of enclosure along many streets.

5e72439f-0292-4ae0-914c-1aff704801ff,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Botolph,"As in the High Medieval Era (RAZ 9.60.21), St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is also one of the most important and interesting of the Lincoln parish churches in the Early Modern Era. Little seems to have been recorded about the church in the later medieval period, although it became the home of the Tilers' Guild of Corpus Christi in the 14th century - not surprisingly perhaps, as the tilery was located just south of the churchyard (RAZ 10.40) (Westlake 1919, 166-175). We should presume that the guild will have had some impact on the late-medieval liturgical layout of the church, but it will also preserve important information about the ritual re-ordering during the Reformation. Although it survived the 1549 amalgamation of parishes, little is heard of it until the Civil War, when it was apparently badly damaged in the siege of 1644 (Hill 1956, 199). Given its strategic location just inside the walls and Sincil Dyke, opposing the entry of Parliamentary forces, it is possible that the church was fortified by the defenders in 1644 and that this was the cause of its ruination. Any such fortifications might be comprehensible in the archaeology of the site. The church was rebuilt somewhat earlier than many in Lincoln, in 1721, before the population of the city began to rise dramatically, and this was, no doubt, due to the fact that after the Civil War there was no church further south than St Peter-at-Gowts. The rebuilt church of 1721 (of which the tower survives) is itself of some interest. Not only did it reuse masonry from the medieval church (and therefore its footings are likely to contain important architectural fragments) but its ritual layout and decoration, as far as can be ascertained, will be of interest as an example of an Anglican building at a time of the growth of dissent. Although the present church on the site dates primarily from 1878, the fabric of the tower contains some reused masonry and works to this fabric must be carefully controlled and recorded. It is said that the present church stands further north in the churchyard than the medieval cruciform structure and consequently any disturbances in the graveyard to the south should be designed to cater for structural as well as graveyard remains. Further south still, the house of the prebend of St Botolph is said to lie under 1-5 Spencer Street, which may have been constructed inside the original churchyard (RAZ 9.60.21). This adds further potential interest to the site, as the structural history of the prebendal house itself extended into the Early Modern Era (and may have been rebuilt in brick in the 15th or 16th century - Soc. Ants. Ms. 786, V, 15). The house will require detailed comparison both with other examples of clergy houses built on churchyards (for example at St John Wigford - RAZ 10.60.23 and St Mary-le-Wigford - RAZ 10.60.26) and with other contemporary housing forms in the city (RAZ 10.34).",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn to include the full presumed extent of the medieval graveyard, including the southern part which was later occupied by the prebendal house.

5e7c24eb-0831-44c1-a0c6-8c1c4adbedaf,LARA RAZ AREA,,The New Market in the High Street (St Lawrence's/ St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parishes south to St Mary-le-Wigford parish,"At the start of the Early Modern Era the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s main markets were all held within streets adjacent to each other on the steepest part of the hillside (RAZ 9.22). We have argued that each street was, in effect, a specialist market ‰Û¡ÌÝÌárow‰Û¡ÌÝå» catering for a specific trade. During the course of the Early Modern Era, however, many of these specialist markets only seem to have maintained their distinctiveness for a limited time. The research agendas for these markets in the first parts of the Early Modern Era are considered individually in RAZs 10.22.1-8. Nothing is heard of specialist markets on the hillside after the 16th century, however, and instead, by the early 17th century, most markets were held in a long sequence in the High Street north and south of Stonebow, which extended from the parishes of St Martin and St Lawrence as far south as the parish of St Mary-le-Wigford - the markets moved from the hillside to the High Street individually and over a period of time.The fish market was located around High Bridge itself by the early 18th century (Hill 1956, 202), and it may have been in operation downhill long before that date (RAZ 10.22.3). It was moved to join the meat market in St Lawrence's churchyard in 1769 (Hill 1966, 145) and both were relocated in purpose-built accommodation on the south side of Clasketgate in 1774 (RAZ 11.24). The corn market was officially moved by the City Council from the foot of Steep Hill to the churchyard of the redundant church of St John (now called Cornhill) in 1598 (HMC 1895, 75), but in 1572 the City ordered that the cross in the parish of St Cuthbert, lately taken down, should be gathered up and stored (HMC 1895, 66; Hill 1948, 154) (RAZ 10.22.2). This might suggest that there had been a building or shelter under which corn-dealing took place, but it also suggests that the market was being relocated. If it did take until 1598 to move, this was one of the latest shifts of market site, and the fact that the new location was so far south may have been the result of other trades having already secured new pitches further north (RAZs 10.22.1-7). Nevertheless, the relocation of the corn market here was probably an attraction which drew traders in oats to the High Street south of High Bridge and into St Mary-le-Wigford parish. The oat market is first recorded in the 'square' formed by the junction of St Mary's Street and High Street by 1615 (Cameron 1985, 31) but by that date it was already 'old'.This long street-market had become firmly established by the early 17th century and continued in use until well into the Industrial Era, although it was held only once a week by the 18th century (Hill 1966, 142-3). Although now grouped together, the individual traders still retained their own discrete trading areas; but even so, the High Street itself was still completely blocked from Cornhill to the Buttermarket on market day at the start of the 19th century (Hill 1966, 214). The Council tried regulation to restrict trading to specified areas but problems persisted until 1847 when the first Corn Exchange (Herridge 1999, No.5047) was built.This aggregation of the specialist medieval markets may reflect the decline in power of the individual guilds in the 16th century, but it must also be an index of the fall-off in economic activity in the city as a whole. Any archaeological information which could throw light on this process of amalgamation of marketing facilities would be welcome. For example it would be very instructive if we could identify archaeological evidence for the laying of new ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápitches‰Û¡ÌÝå» for individual traders in the newly designated street. Furthermore, if such details could be recognised, we could estimate whether the relocation of the markets was conducted as part of a single programme of reorganisation ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáfrom above‰Û¡ÌÝå» by the City Council, or whether it was more of a spontaneous development by the market traders themselves. The coming together of the different medieval markets w",Summary,"The RAZ includes the High Street itself from the Strait to the churchyard of St Mary-le-Wigford. It also includes the properties extending back from the High Street, which will have serviced the merchants‰Û¡ÌÝå» street-front buildings. Collections of finds from pits in such backyards have proved valuable indicators of the trading prosperity of the shops on the street front in other towns and should be explored in Lincoln with the development of the market in mind.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.22.9,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.22.9,

5efdd983-8e12-48f8-a3af-d8ba4ac7e1ed,LARA RAZ AREA,,Lunatic Asylum (The Lawn Hospital),"Following the opening of the County Hospital (RAZ 11.52.1), discussions had been held about the need for an asylum for the treatment of the mentally ill and a fund was promoted by the famous Dr Willis of Greatford. In 1819 an asylum was founded and in 1820 the current buildings (designed by Richard Ingleman) were opened (Melton nd., part 1). From the start, under Dr E.P. Charlesworth, the Lawn‰Û¡ÌÝå»s policy was to follow the pioneering work with the mentally ill established in advanced hospitals like The Retreat at York, and consequently the layout of the original hospital buildings, as well as the way in which they developed subsequently, is of very great interest nationally. Especially notable is the extent to which patients were given liberty to enter and leave their rooms in the early years and to work in the building or in the garden. Consequently the architectural details such as window fixtures and door locks will be of interest, as their character and date will chart the development of thinking about security. The buildings were extended several times before 1945, in particular in 1893, when new kitchens, waiting rooms and offices were supplied (designed by the Lincoln architect W. Scorer). Enclosed ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáairing‰Û¡ÌÝå» courts were provided for those inmates who were not able to use the grounds, but the most interesting component of this new building was the hall, which contained a small purpose-built theatre. Apparently theatrical productions played a useful part in the treatment of certain categories of patient and this theatre was deliberately designed to be used by the patients as part of their treatment. The internal details of this unusual and interesting structure must be recorded in conjunction with repair and alteration programmes. The layout and architectural details of the nurses' hostel of 1938 deserve comparison with that provided for nurses at the County Hospital in 1914 (RAZ 11.52.2) and at the Bromhead Nursing Home (RAZ 11.52.4), and there will be interest in evidence of increase comfort and status of the nurses following the public adulation during the First World War. Like the new County Hospital of the 1870s, the designers and managers of the Lawn saw the setting of the hospital buildings as important to the recovery of the patients and there are records of trees of certain types being planted to try and shield the buildings from ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápoisonous miasmas‰Û¡ÌÝå» which drifted up from the valley below (Melton nd., 13). It is important, therefore, that records are made of the surviving planting and that replacement planting is considered against this therapeutic tradition. The layout and planting of the will make an interesting contrast with other gardens in the city (RAZ 11.28; 11.19.2; 11.20; 11.34 etc).

5f7eaefb-cb57-4ada-aeb1-9856306ce555,LARA RAZ AREA,,Friary of the Sack and the Kyme Chantry,"The four friaries of the major orders in Lincoln (Augustinian, Carmelite, Dominican and Franciscan) represent a good group by national standards, and in addition, Lincoln has a relatively rare example of a Friary of the Sack. The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In all four, of course, the churches and other claustral buildings will be of interest and plans need to be recovered, but we know a great deal about fraternal plans (e.g. Butler 1984) and attention should now be turning to more complex aspects of the archaeology of friaries. One of the new avenues requiring exploration is the study of burial populations at friaries; cemeteries will be of interest as valuable resources for paleo-pathology, but although we have a certain level of documentation about burials in the Lincoln friaries, we badly need a fully excavated graveyard to provide a proper sample. Some burials have been excavated under the Carmelite Friary, but it is not clear what percentage of the total they represent. These types of studies may be best targeted at the Austin Friary in Newport, which seems to be almost completely undisturbed. Consequently, any development proposals here should be accompanied by provision for the archaeological excavation of the complete church and burial ground. A similar opportunity may also exist at the Blackfriars, although the many reports of burials found here over the years suggest that this burial population may have been compromised already.The Friary of the Sack in Lincoln is a site of some rarity and importance nationally. According to Butler (1984) it seems that none of the seventeen English friaries of this order has been subject to modern archaeological investigation. Consequently we have only a general idea what to expect of a Sack Friars site, but should probably presume that the layout of their buildings followed the norms established by the more major orders, with a church and cloister and associated buildings within a walled precinct. The Sack Friars were particularly devoted to learning and they were, consequently, similar in their profession to the Dominicans. Comparison between the Lincoln Sack Friars and the Blackfriars 100m to the north (RAZ 9.53.2) would therefore be particularly instructive. It is possible that some of the deeper features on the Sack Friary site will be waterlogged, opening up important possibilities for study of organic deposits and for environmental sampling, and these activities should play a full part in future work on the site.The site has a similar origin, and consequently similar interest, to the Greyfriary, in that the citizens and the king granted them city property and land adjacent (evidently a group of houses) which the friars first converted and then redeveloped. The archaeology of this process will be of considerable interest (see RAZ 9.53.4 and 9.25). By 1268, however, the friars were building their church and had, presumably, provided themselves with a conventual layout (ed. Page 1906, 225). The site is also of particular interest because of the way it was treated after the closure of the order of the Sack Friars. The order was prevented from taking on new members in 1274, with the intention that its man-power should be diverted into one of the better-established orders. By 1300 there were only four friars left here and by 1307 the site had become available for re-use (ed. Page 1906, 225). As the property had been granted by the city and the Crown jointly, these two agencies assumed responsibility for disposal of the buildings once the friary had closed. They entertained a proposal that the Abbey of Barlings should convert the buildings into warehouses - a use to which much of the property in this area had evidently become devoted (RAZ 9.2). Their proposal was rejected, however, and, instead, by 1327 the Dean and Chapter seem to have assumed responsibility for providing priests to continue to",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn around the presumed precinct boundary of the Sack Friars site. None of the boundary points is securely known and the mapped RAZ is based on elimination of surrounding properties. We can presume, however, that it was an approximately rectangular precinct ,as it was said to be 540 x 420 feet in dimensions in the 13th century (ed.

600acf9d-c7c9-4420-a02f-385ea7ccaea3,LARA RAZ AREA,,Newport market,"Newport was a major market laid out on either side of Ermine street north of the walled city (chapter 9a). The suburb takes the simple form of two rows of properties on either side of a broad street (Ermine Street). Although there seem to have been lanes leading eastwards and westwards towards its southern end, the entire suburb, or at least that part north of Rasen Lane, was probably laid out to accommodate the market, suggesting a single authority was involved. This is also the implication of the fact that it was surrounded with a bank and ditch (RAZ 9.51.1), and the fact that it remained part of the city may suggest that the civic authorities were behind the foundation. Within the properties which line the suburb, future work might concentrate on these questions about the suburb's foundation. The market was originally cigar-shaped and much wider than it had become by the time of Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map. The houses which originally fronted on to the western side of the market street are located within what had become by 1842 the backyards of houses fronting the later street. Along the west side much of the former market street was occupied in 1842 by the front yards of houses which probably occupied the original street front line. These changes in the width of the market street mean that properties of the original market will survive relatively undamaged by the rebuilding of houses on the same site, and complete investigation of at least one such property should be a priority. They also offer the prospect that the original surfaces of the market street might be preserved, and, such surfaces (with the possible evidence for stalls and other temporary structures) should also be the target of future archaeological research. We know from documentary sources that the suburb is much older than the grant of its market charter in 1330, but the form taken by the property blocks, the width of the road and the location of St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church in the centre of the street, all point to the suburb having had an origin in a market place at a much earlier date. Work on the defences of Newport (ideally sections across them - RAZ 9.51.1) might also concentrate on the recovery of dating information for the foundation of the suburb. The location of the church of St John (RAZ 9.60.1), in the centre of the putative market street is also fundamental. It is possible that the church was here before the market, but given the other evidence that its parish was cut out of St Nicholas, it is much more likely to be a foundation contemporary with the layout of the market itself. As the church was already a parochial one by the early 12th century, both would seem, therefore, to have been founded before this date. The fact that St John is mostly within the present street presents both a difficult heritage management problem and an important opportunity. The main road is likely to be worked on continuously and all such works must be watched within the RAZ for remains of St John's (RAZ 9.60.1 below) to ensure that the continual attrition of the site is at least recorded if it cannot be stopped. The church of St Nicholas (RAZ 9.60.2 below), on the other hand, may have been a church foundation made just outside the north gate and at an earlier stage of the town‰Û¡ÌÝå»s development than St John. It could well pre-date the establishment of any housing in the suburb and it is likely to pre-date the market. Dating information for its sequence of development will, therefore be very helpful. The Augustinian Friary is a late interloper into the topography of Newport and, although important in its own right (RAZ 9.53.1), it is less significant for the development of the Newport suburb. Like the early market at Eastgate (RAZ 9.17) and perhaps also the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s High Market (RAZ 9.22), the Newport market street was also supplied with a large public well, known as Grantham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Well, which is shown on Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1722 in the centre of the green mid way between the two c",Summary,"The RAZ for the market includes the broad street itself, with the intention of managing deposits and structures related to the market itself.

609a41ca-f85f-4a25-abff-0946d32f37ce,LARA RAZ AREA,,"Common ""diggings"" in the cliff faces north-west and south of the city","The limestone, ironstone, gravel and clay which outcrops along the cliff edge north-west of the occupied area of the city were important natural resources for the people of the medieval city, as they must have been for the Romans before them (RAZ 7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.14). Although there is said to be some earthwork evidence for diggings at the northern end of the modern West Common (pers. com. P Everson), and the earthwork remains of quarrying on South Common are very evident, there seems to be little documentary evidence for quarrying of any sort on either common during the Middle Ages. From the great number of fine buildings constructed from Lincoln stone, both in Lincoln and the vicinity, however, we can be sure that the stone was prized and greatly used, so we should ask why this important industry has left little documentary record. One reason for this lack of documentation might be that quarrying (both for stone and other materials) was not organised on an institutional basis. This type of working is, after all, what we might expect in the cliff faces north-west and south of the city, which are known to have been city commons. Although there is no documentation for the practice, it may be that the citizens extracted stone and clay as part of their common rights in these areas. This issue can be addressed archaeologically, as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon diggings‰Û¡ÌÝå» are likely to have a completely different character compared with commercially owned and managed workings. Future archaeological explorations in these areas, then, should aim at establishing how large each winning was, and estimate whether it had been opened and worked by a single individual, or family, rather than by a commercial or institutional operation. A murder which took place in a quarry in Canwick parish in 1202 (ed. Stenton 1926, 137 No.805) may have taken place in such common diggings, as it was presumably adjacent to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s South Common. More clearly we can make a case that ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon diggings‰Û¡ÌÝå» of this sort, rather than privately owned quarries, were the subject of complaints by the Hundred Roll jurors after 1275 when it was said that William de Holgate had removed stone from the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáking‰Û¡ÌÝå»s quarry‰Û¡ÌÝå» (i.e. the commons quarry?), had it squared by stonemasons and then sent to Boston for house-building (Hill 1948, 212). This seems to be a complaint that a public or common resource was being appropriated for private profit by Holgate. It is not known where the quarries used by Holgate were, but if they were ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon‰Û¡ÌÝå» then they were probably part of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon fields‰Û¡ÌÝå» and therefore along the cliff edges west or south of the city. The techniques used for such ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon diggings‰Û¡ÌÝå» will also be of considerable interest, especially if they can be compared with technology employed in larger-scale, more commercial, quarrying (for example RAZ 9.41.2). A research agenda for this topic has recently been issued (LUAU 1996a).It is simply not known whether the ferruginous, lower Lincolnshire limestone, or ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáNorthamptonshire Ironstone‰Û¡ÌÝå», below the building stone was also quarried in these common areas, or, if it was, how the resulting ore was then smelted. It is not impossible that small-scale smelting operations would have been set up by groupings of commoners nearby, and the remains of such establishments should be searched for in the archaeological record. However, as yet we have no documentary or archaeological evidence to call on in locating any such installations. A research agenda for this topic has been issued (Crossley 1994; Instone 1995).Similar research questions to those aimed at understanding stone-winning can also be addressed in future work on the clay diggings on the Commons, which lie below the stone-winning in the cliff face. Here again we should be looking for archaeological evidence in the cliff faces both north-west and south of the city for evidence of small-scale individual enterprise consistent with the exploitation of common rights, rather than larger more or",Summary,"The RAZ is in two parts and the boundaries of both parts are governed by the likely presence of the raw materials being exploited. Stone quarrying at the top of the cliff means that the RAZ boundary runs along the tops of the cliff in both southern and northern parts of the RAZ. The clay digging occurred towards the base of the cliff, but ancillary operations, such as stone cutting, lime-burning, iron-smelting or clay preparation are likely to have extended on to the flat land in the valley floor. We should note that there is reference to a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon kiln‰Û¡ÌÝå» for lime-burning in the mid-16th century (Hill 1956, 83), although we have no information about its location. The RAZ boundary at the base of the cliff therefore extends (in the case of the South Common) as far north as Sincil Dyke and (in the case of the West Common) as far south as edge of the hard land defined by the boundary of RAZ 9.7. The other boundaries of the southern part of this RAZ are governed by the District Council boundary, and so is the north-western boundary of the northern part. The south-eastern boundary of the northern part of the RAZ is drawn along the line of the city wall, to the east of which there was probably never any communal quarrying, even if small-scale workings were undertaken by individual property owners.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.41.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.41.1,

60a0ad40-38b2-4cb6-a25d-73c178e43aa2,LARA RAZ AREA,,Stamp End causeway,"As in all the other Eras, the structure and use of the Stamp End lock is likely to be vital in understanding the physical and commercial development of the city in the Early Modern Era (RAZs 5.2, 6.4, 7.13, 8.3.2, 9.1). We should look, therefore, for evidence of the dates at which the structure was repaired and re-edified and compare these closely with what is already known about the dates at which the quaysides upstream were constructed and areas of pool reclaimed.It is in the Early Modern Era that we get the first documentary evidence for the presence of the causeway. The earliest such reference is apparently in a City Charter of the early 15h century (Lincolnshire Archives Office City Charters 6/54 - for subsequent references see Cameron 1985, 102) but, although the references show that the causeway was a major feature in the landscape at this date, unfortunately they do not provide us with any information about how it worked. We need to know what provision was made for boats to pass around the terminal ends of the causeway On the way upstream it is likely that there would have been facilities to enable boats to be carried round the dam in a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáportage‰Û¡ÌÝå», and evidence for this might survive in the form of slip-ways by means of which boats would be hauled out of the water. It is also likely that laden boats would have passed downstream through ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáflash locks‰Û¡ÌÝå». The massive structures needed for these are likely to survive within the fabric of the dam. One might also expect the dam to have been used as a convenient location for mills, utilising the head of water behind. There is no documentary evidence for such features, but their presence might be searched for here. Dr Vince has also raised the question of whether the causeway might have been used to bring cattle, other stock and wagons from the south towards the fairs on St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Croft (chapter 10a). If this was the case, we would expect a substantial bridge spanning the main channel of the river, the main supports for which may survive in the modern river bed.",Summary,"The precise location of the medieval Stamp End causeway is not known, but it is likely to have been within 100m of the modern lock, probably to its east rather than to its west.

But we have already seen that its location on an island (RAZ 6.3) within the once-sacred pool (RAZ 5.2 and 5.8), as well as the character and very early date of the structures here might encourage an interpretation as a temple of some type. This identification seems to be confirmed by discoveries of the colonia period. The building undoubtedly went through a series of transformations, but one of these was into a circular structure (which is an unusual form of building to find in a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» house) whilst, in another phase, the building was associated with a large deposit of similar ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádrinking vessels‰Û¡ÌÝå» - which might be seen as specially provided cups for libations, not dissimilar to the finds of specifically manufactured glasses used for libations in the temple at Castleford (ed. Cool and Philo 1998, 369-71; Abramson, Berg and Fossick 1999, 300-4). As has already been said, this building is of the greatest interest and all ground disturbance near it should be controlled, with the aim of collecting further artefacts to add to the excavated assemblage. Given the manner in which interpretation of this structure has changed since excavation, a comprehensive reconsideration of all the relevant evidence is due and should be undertaken as a priority. Future work might focus on understanding the nature of cult activities here, identifying the cult (if possible) and establishing what impact any temple had on its surrounding settlement.",Summary,"As in previous phases the boundaries of the RAZ cannot be closely defined. Whereas the whole extent of the island (whose northern and western boundaries are known approximately) has been included in previous RAZs, it is perhaps quite likely that adjacent parts of the island will have been occupied by unrelated, possibly commercial, buildings in the Colonia Era.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.21.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.21.1,

The picture of population decline, however, was not uniform and in 1362 the Guild of St Bavo was formed in the church (Westlake 1919, 166-175) and we might expect the guild to have had an impact on the liturgical layout of the church.

61ebdc29-028e-4b44-ae6b-095f4ec1cb42,LARA RAZ AREA,,Boultham,"Boultham is almost unknown archaeologically, but because it has been preserved under Victorian parkland it is likely that the village‰Û¡ÌÝå»s settlement archaeology survives particularly well. A research agenda for this topic is currently in production as part of the East Midlands Research Agenda process (Courtney 2001; Everson 2000), but settlement in the area has been characterised by Robert and Wrathmell (2000) and their characterisation raises several of the key questions. In common with most settlements in CLNSC, Boultham is likely to be based on a manorial curia, the location of which is unknown, although it may be somewhere near the church. Many village tofts have been excavated in Lincolnshire and in the East Midlands more widely, but, nevertheless, further information is almost always valuable. In the case of Boultham, exploration of the tofts should focus on particular characteristics which might be distinctive here, both on account of the settlement‰Û¡ÌÝå»s local topography and its proximity to the city.The RAZ includes the site and surviving structure of the parish church of St Helen. This building was extensively rebuilt in 1864 and 1887, but it retains some earlier architectural details reused in later fabric. All works in and around the church should be subject to detailed archaeological recording in order that the structural history of the church can be elucidated. In this case we should be interested in what size of church a modest early-modern settlement the size of Boultham could sustain. In the Early Modern Era the church may have seen little use, but, nevertheless, the manner in which the church was occupied whilst in decline is likely to be of interest. The burial ground has been the subject of considerable modern disturbance and it may not be easy to isolate burials of the Early Modern Era. If such burials can be isolated, however, they should be compared with comparable urban populations from the city to establish similarities and differences between urban and rural populations. The poor soils in the parish, commented on by Arthur Young in 1771 (Hill 1966, 113), were no doubt partly responsible for the small scale of settlement here in the Early Modern Era, but it is unlikely that the managed woodlands which occupied most of the parish were unproductive - on the contrary the woodlands were a valuable economic resource (RAZ 10.6). There must have been a considerable trade in wood, probably coppiced, and perhaps also peat from the fringes of the Swanpool to the north, for use in the city. This woodland character of the parish connects it with the large areas of wood which are known to have existed in parishes on similar geologies to the south-west and west (Darby 1952, 91-2; Cole 1897-8, 382 etc.). These areas are known to have been used for pannage in Swinderby (Darby 1952, 57-8) and this may also have been an important activity in Boultham. Any such unusual aspects of Boultham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s agricultural economy should be comprehensible in the village RAZ in the numbers and forms of buildings in the tofts, compared with those in settlements like Bracebridge. But these aspects of Boultham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s history might be explored even more cost-effectively through extensive environmental sampling - especially on the edges of the wetland. Distinctive aspects of Boultham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s settlement archaeology may be due to the proximity of the market in the city for firewood, constructional timber, peat or pork, but we will learn a great deal, also, from comparison with the equivalent settlement at Bracebridge. Although only 1km away, Bracebridge is a quite different type of settlement in terms of its agricultural hinterland and economy, but we think that it too may have specialised in order to supply the city with certain staples (RAZs 10.8.3 & 10.10). Presumably there is a symbiotic relationship here; Boultham and Bracebridge could have provided different raw materials and may have specialised in order not to compete with each other. In this r",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the known area of tofts and crofts, including also, presumably, the manorial curia, as well as an extension southwards into Boultham Park, to include the dam which forms the lake on the Pike Drain, and which may preserve the remains of earlier crossings towards the village.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.11,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.11,

It was replaced c.1755 by a brick structure designed by John Hayward (Hill 1966, 145). This bridge was illegally replaced on a slightly different site by the Witham Navigation company in 1827, perhaps as part of efforts to make the Sincil Dyke navigable (RAZ 11.4.1- Herridge 1999, 5325). In 1848 this bridge was itself replaced by the bridge mapped on the 1887 O.S. linking Oxford Street and Norman Street. This bridge was removed in 1955 when Sincil Dyke was culverted along the length of Napoleon Place to Pelham Street. The abutments for these various bridges will provide useful evidence as to the characters of the various structures here.

62e7cc97-7d16-49c1-a258-cae22fe9d2d6,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Peter-at-Pleas and St Peter-at-Arches,"The twinned churches of St Peter-at-Arches and St Peter-at-Pleas have always been one of the most important groupings in the city (RAZ 9.60.44). In the later Middle Ages St Peter-at-Arches was selected to contain most of the civic rituals, leaving St Peter-at-Pleas, presumably, with more nominal parochial responsibilities, although it would be wrong to think that St Peter-at-Pleas was in complete decline relative to its neighbour. Elite burials were still being made here as late as 1521 and there is a mention of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáworks‰Û¡ÌÝå» being done to the fabric (ed. Foster 1914, 87-8). Even so there are many more bequests in surviving wills to St Peter-at-Arches including a string of wealthy citizens in the later 15th and early 16th centuries (ed. Gibbon 1888, 134; ed. Foster 1914, 37, 44-5, 153-5). This developing contrast between the two churches in the late Middle Ages must be a matter of considerable interest - particularly if differences in the liturgical function of the two churches could be established. In both cases we should expect this civic patronage to have effects in the ritual layout of the churches and we might expect subsidiary chapels. The 1506 will of William Tucker mentions the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácross aisle‰Û¡ÌÝå» which suggests that St Peter-at-Pleas church had a transept - a feature we only know elsewhere in Lincoln at St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (ed. Foster 1914, 30). On the other hand, in 1511 an anchoress is recorded at St Peter-at-Arches (ed. Foster 1914, 44-5) and the way in which she interacted with the congregation will be detectable archaeologically and will be of great interest. It is likely that she will have had some domestic accommodation outside the liturgical space of the church, perhaps in the churchyard and this should be hunted for in future work. The same patronage, which resulted in many burials inside the churches, will have also resulted in the accumulation of a group of elite burials outside in the shared graveyard and the distribution of these will be of great interest. Do they focus on one of the two churches or are they evenly distributed? Did the moot stone itself attract or repel burials, and, if it did, were they of high status? St Peter-at-Pleas parish was united with St Peter-at-Arches in 1542 and the church was demolished (HMC 1895, 38) and so it will preserve the layout of an important example of a major city church at the very start of the Reformation. It will be a matter of great interest, in fact, to see if any alterations to the liturgical arrangement had taken place by this date. Although the major iconoclasm took place five or ten years later, this was one of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s most prominent churches and patronised by the City Council itself and it may give some hints as to the ideological orientation of the city elite at this crucial moment. The site was subsequently used by the butter market, which moved here in 1572 (RAZ 10.22.8), but it is not clear that there was any structure built here to shelter vendors until the new Assembly Rooms of 1736.St Peter-at-Arches, on the other hand, became the main church for civic patronage, and we might expect it to have been radically re-organised in the Reformation. It was probably the church at which the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s official preacher preached and this might have also entailed some re-organisation of the interior (Hill 1956, 101 etc.). Evidence for such re-orderings may be detectable archaeologically. The medieval church was completely demolished and replaced in 1719-24 by a very grand new building costing the city Ì´å£3,373 and expressing, they thought, the civic pride of the town (HMC 1895, 115-6). The early 18th-century church was a major new building, and rare in the city at the time. It offers us the opportunity of understanding both the technological accomplishments of early 18th-century builders and engineers as well as demonstrating in its layout the religious cast of mind of the contemporary city fathers. The building was an important and prestigious piece of architecture,",Summary,"The RAZ follows the north, west and east boundaries of the original medieval cemetery, which are known from early mapping.

Only one such road lead into the southern part of the city, the road to Canwick and villages beyond. This road was probably originally only defined by the tracks of vehicles which used it across South Common, although it is now marked mostly by South Park Avenue and South Park. The fact that the stretch along South Park is no longer used as a major highway probably gives an excellent opportunity to investigate its antiquity and, towards its eastern end, it is likely that some earthwork evidence for its junction with the road up the hill to Canwick will survive. This road lies only partly within the city boundary, but the deep hollow way suggests that the medieval road to Canwick and Branston was on the modern line (although the cutting was made deeper at the request of the stage-coach companies in 1846 Hill 1948, 231, n1). Eastwards from the road junction at the foot of the hill the medieval road to Washingborough and Bardney follows the line of modern Washingborough Road, whilst to the north there is likely to have been a route leading to the south end of the Stamp End causeway. This will have passed well to the east of modern Canwick Road and its southernmost parts may be detectable as earthworks in the field north of the Old Cemetery. Part of its line, however, may have been taken by the Lincoln-Grantham railway line. As is the case with all the other roads, any information about the lines taken by the roads of this network south-east of the city will be of great help in understanding Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s links with its surrounding villages, whilst any dating evidence for the first layout of these roads will be of great importance in understanding the reconstruction of the town as a local population centre following the early medieval period. In particular evidence for the date at which the road towards the Stamp End causeway was (re)established will be of fundamental importance to our understanding of the re-invigoration of the city.North and east of the city similar ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáintermediate‰Û¡ÌÝå» roads occupied the lines of Greetwell Road, Wragby Road, Nettleham Road and the road(s) to the west of the Castle. Any or all of the these roads might have adopted the lines of Roman roads so their stratigraphic and alignment relationships with the early routes will be of great interest. North-west of the city the roads across the western fields can be studied through an intensive search of early air photographs as well as in ancient mapping. There seem to be four potential intermediate routes heading in this direction. The road now known as Carholme Road seems to have been a relatively important route, known as Stowgate in the 13th century. Cliffgate, coming down the scarp from the west gate postern in the upper city, cut diagonally across the open fields to join Stowgate to the east of Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Bridge on the city boundary. In addition it is highly likely that the road which linked the villages along the scarp foot north of Lincoln continued south of Burton parish and entered the city on the western side. Mr Everson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s study of the development of Burton village shows that this road originally (i.e. probably throughout the High Medieval Era) hugged the scarp foot (Everson et al. 1991) and would probably have arrived at Willingthorpe (RAZ 9.32.1). Later this road was re-aligned to run along a similar line to the north-west/south-east stretch of Long Leys Road and may have originally entered the city along the line of the modern West Parade. The roads which linked the village of Boultham to the Newark Road to the south and to Skellingthorpe to the west, and the road which went southwards from Bracebridge towards Brant Broughton ought to be considered in this category also.

This fine building survives in a remarkably original form and its design, carefully segregating the different status of people who had business in the court and providing them each with their own access routes, is highly expressive of the social basis of judicial functions in the early 19th century. In a recognisably 19th-century manner, the jury room is placed at the heart of the building (in both plan and faÌÎå_ade) just as the jury was increasingly being seen as the heart of the judicial process. Records must be made of both details and plans of the building in conjunction with repair and restoration programmes, aimed at exploring these sociological distinctions.",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the boundaries depicted on the 1887 O.S. map and includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.66.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.66.1,

64d382dc-fc49-4d9b-a8da-3b820a9f0d7c,LARA RAZ AREA,,Eastgate market,"It has been proposed that the distinctive shape of the large open triangular space between Greetwell Road and Langworthgate suggests the existence of an early market held here (chapter 9a; RAZ 9.17). A public well, the Leadenwell, stood near the apex of the triangular plot of land and a maypole had been erected here before being depicted on Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1722. Both of these prominent features in the local topography were evidently maintained and ornamented during the Early Modern Era. The pre-history of the maypole is of considerable interest. Was there a history of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáunofficial‰Û¡ÌÝå» public ceremony here, or was the maypole simply sited for pragmatic reasons? And if the maypole was a centre of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáunofficial‰Û¡ÌÝå» gatherings, was the market itself ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáunofficial‰Û¡ÌÝå»? Certainly there seems to be no substantive documentary evidence for the market place or what might have been sold there. The well-head is likely to have been maintained in the Early Modern Era and the date of the well cap may give us some indication when the market or gathering place was last used. The tiles of St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church (RAZ 10.60.6) were ordered to be sold in 1535 (HMC 1895, 34) and, presumably, the programme of demolition and the abandonment of the churchyard would have doubled the size of the market area.

65b8589b-ad80-4610-9426-d384a8043a7e,LARA RAZ AREA,,Quarries,"Lincoln stone had always been an important raw material in the city. This was as true in the Anglo-Scandinavian and Norman periods as it had been in the Roman period. Dr Vince has shown that the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s stone quarries can be divided into two types. First a group of excavations into the exposures of Lincolnshire limestone in the cliff faces and secondly areas of stone-pit diggings around the north and east side of the upper city. Stone was not the only material quarried in High Medieval Lincoln. The second important material won from the cliff-faces was a tough clay, suitable for pottery manufacture (and no doubt for other purposes also). The clay lay just below the stone layers and consequently diggings for clay will be mixed with diggings for stone, indeed in some cases the same excavations will have served for both materials. There were clay pits below the line of mills on West Common which were mentioned in 1581 (Hill 1948, 334), although we have no evidence that the Roman kilns (RAZ 7.4.1) known to have exploited this source were replaced by medieval ones. There were also, very probably, similar clay diggings to the east of the city in the land later occupied by the parish of Holy Trinity Butwerk and the Blackfriars. These latter sources of clay will have been the source of raw material for the pottery kilns along the lower part of Pottergate (RAZ 9.39, 9. 40.1). It is highly likely that some of the fine series of earthworks on South Common also represent clay digging, and it is not impossible that pottery kiln sites remain to be discovered below them, in a mirror image of the situation across the valley. As yet, however, there is no archaeological or documentary trace of any such kilns.",Summary,,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.41,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.41,

It seems likely that it was an enclosed religious house of some sort, founded in the early 12th century by Ranulf Earl of Chester and others (Thompson 1913-4, 46-7; Owen 1971, 149; Hockley 1992). It was subsequently a small monastic cell of Bardney Abbey (Owen 1971, 13, 48, 56). This is probably the same institution in which Edward II funded a corrody for one of his servants in 1311 (ed. Page 1906, 234), although it also seems to have been a hospital for the poor (ibid.). The institution seems to have been last mentioned as a religious institution in 1401 (Cameron 1985, 129).This obscure monastic site is potentially of the greatest interest. It seems to have the same character as the so called ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhospital‰Û¡ÌÝå» at Partney, which was also a cell of Bardney Abbey set on an 'island' site (Stocker 1993a). If this parallel is valid we should be suspecting St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hartsholme of being an early (i.e. pre-Viking) church site which was given to Bardney on its re-foundation in recognition of its early status. Such early monastic sites are extremely rare and fragile, and being set within the Brayford Pool, St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hartsholme has the additional importance that the rare archaeology will be exceptionally well preserved in the waterlogged conditions. We need to know how the minor pagan site (presumed in RAZ 7.21.2) developed into an early Christian one. What use did the new religion make of the structures of the old? Were they destroyed and denigrated or were they adopted and transformed as so often seems to be case? Was any early site here uniquely devoted to religion, or was it, like Flixborough, a site where the religious and the secular co-existed? What was the impact of the Viking invasions and did occupation cease or was it just religious life here which declined? Even the post-12th-century institution is of considerable rarity as a type and, even if it turns out to be founded de novo at that date, it still offers an excellent opportunity to study an institution which remains inaccessible through the surviving documents. The quality and importance of the site means that archaeological work here will need to be on a large scale. This type of site is hard to understand in small holes and a major area excavation will be necessary to achieve a proper understanding.",Summary,In recent times it has been suggested that the institution occupied the identified site called Haw Hill (Hockley 1992).

We have documentary evidence that weaving sheds and other facilities associated with the production of cloth were located within this area. The archaeological evidence for the industry will consist not just of distinctive buildings types, however, but also a range of small finds associated with the upright looms on which the cloth was woven. Other phases in the production of cloth were also undertaken in this area. Evidence for dyeing, in the form of industrial residues, will be particularly valuable, as the Lincoln dyestuffs, particularly granum (made from insects), were imported from the Mediterranean and were said to be the ingredient which gave Lincoln scarlet its distinctive quality. Similarly, whilst spinning may have remained a domestic activity, we know nothing about fulling or finishing in the city, although there is plenty of evidence that these were major industries. The Millhouse reported in All Saints Hungate parish in 1362 was presumably a mill associated with fulling or dyeing, although it was reported late in the history of the Lincoln industry (Cameron 1985, 184), and, although it must have been quite close to the river (or to the Crackpool) to provide its power, we have no indication where it was located. Although we have, thanks to Bischoff‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work (1975), a clear date for the collapse of the industry in the final quarter of the 13th century, we have little information about its start. Was the industry introduced after the Conquest or was it in existence before? Might it even have been introduced in the period of civic renewal in the early 12th century? Archaeology also offers us the prospect of helping answer some of Bischoff‰Û¡ÌÝå»s questions about the catastrophic collapse of the industry. He believes (1975, 277-87) that one of the principal causes for the catastrophic decline in the Lincoln cloth trade was a critical under-investment in plant, which meant that Lincoln cloth producers could only look on as they were undercut by cheaper quality cloths from abroad. Future excavations may help us to understand the extent to which simple upright looms had been replaced by the more-advanced horizontal looms in Lincoln, and whether the treading of the woven cloth by feet in purpose-made troughs was replaced by water-powered hammers.

Although gravel may have been dug in many locations in the valley floor through time, the only area of which we have any knowledge is that to the south-west of Wigford. Here the gravel lies interleaved with clay beds, and in the Industrial Era these deposits were heavily exploited. In particular, the area around the village of Boultham, along either side of the Prial Brook, and eastwards towards the Midland Railway line, was greatly affected. The advance of the various pits can be seen on successive editions of the OS map series, but it is clear that a great deal was removed during the 1840s and 50s, when railway construction was at its peak. John Herridge‰Û¡ÌÝå»s survey identified eight major pits in the Boultham area (Herridge 1999, Nos. 5194 - 5201). Although the remains of the pits themselves are now largely of landscape value, the approach roads leading to them and the processing sites associated with them will cast some light on the technology used in extraction, grading and transportation, and future work in the area should aim to document any such processing sites which have survived.",Summary,The RAZ boundaries are drawn to include the pits themselves and extensions on to adjoining land where a processing site can be identified. Such processing sites will be most easily derived from historic mapping.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.41.7,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.41.7,

Little is known about it, but its layout will be of considerable interest. It would be helpful to know its capacity and whether or not the station offered fire-fighters other facilities beside garaging. Was there any accommodation on the premises for example?Partly because the police also served as firemen, the fire brigade had been established next to the Police Station at the Sessions House since at least the 1880s (Hill 1974, 221; RCHME 1997) and the city purchased its first steam-powered water pump in 1882 (Wright 1982, 233). The former fire station of 1906, where this pump was housed, giving on to Monks Road (now partly used as Training Office, Lincoln College - Herridge 1999, No.5020) is an important survival of a potentially rare category of building nationally. Yet Lincoln has two such early buildings - the other is the former Fire Station at 39, Church Lane (Herridge 1999, No.5043). The latter is both older (datestone of 1880) and more elaborate than the Monks Road example, although it is now in domestic use. Both buildings should preserve evidence in their fabric for arrangements for horse-drawn emergency vehicles, as the city brigade did not invest in a motor fire engine (a Dennis) until 1910 (Wright 1982, 233). Furthermore, both buildings should preserve interesting evidence for the changes brought about by the change in power sources. Both buildings should be subject to recording programmes during the course of repair and alteration.",Summary,"The RAZ components are mapped following the sites‰Û¡ÌÝå» boundaries depicted on the 1887 O.S. map, and including a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.5,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.5,

676ef590-1de3-4996-81ee-559640d0ea83,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Boultham Mere Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Boultham Mere Character Area is on the fringe of the City at the intersection of a number of watercourses and railway lines such as the important Fossdyke Navigation. The area contains Boultham Mere itself and woodland including Spike Island. Historically, the area has been wetland and its character is largely influenced by developments in the 19th century including the railways, their associated structures and the drainage dykes including Main Drain and the 20th century including the mere and woodland. The Fossdyke probably survives from the medieval period or earlier.Boultham Mere is a lake surrounded by reedbed, wet woodland and embankments. It is primarily managed for nature conservation but has associated recreational and educational uses. The lake is isolated and very tranquil despite being adjacent to a railway line and industrial sites. It is important for its breeding bird population, especially birds of national and regional importance such as bittern, willow tit and common tern. Spike Island is a triangular piece of woodland with very limited access to the public as it is surrounded on all sides by railway lines. There are a number of footpaths along the various watercourses. The main footpath, to the north of the Fossdyke Canal, is well used by walkers, horse riders and cyclists for recreation purposes. The canal itself is well used by leisure boats.This area of green space is an important component of the character of Lincoln. It is part of a large area of open space on the western side of the City that, together with areas of green space to the east of the city, brings non-urban areas close to the city centre and helps provide the important, close rural setting of the City as a whole. The canal in particular is important as a link between the City and the country. The change in character of the area can be traced as it gets further away from the city centre, starting with the university, industry and housing, and passing moored houseboats until open farmland is reached to the west. In parts of this Character Area, the urban and rural characteristics can be felt at the same time. For example, the rural character of the woodland and lake contrasts with the urban sounds of industry and the railway.

With the exception of the Fossdyke, the mainly impermeable boundaries of the area formed by the railway and dykes create an area that is discrete and quite isolated.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 33,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,49,

To the east, the modern city boundary takes in small areas (relatively speaking) of the field systems of the parishes of Nettleham and Greetwell. Nettleham was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1777 (Baker 1957, 51-9) whilst Greetwell was enclosed by private treaty (Everson et al. 1991, 103-5).The archaeology of the fields in these parishes is likely to be rather coarse and uninformative on a small scale. The most informative studies will be those conducted on air photos taken before the redevelopment for housing. Some of these show evidence for ridge and furrow and, using early mapping (and the Enclosure Award for Nettleham), it may be possible to develop a picture of these field systems in their final stages. A research agenda for such systems has been articulated by D. Hall (1994). Excavation may be a less effective technique of exploration here, but even so, soil analyses from widely scattered sites in the fields may provide useful information about relative fertility and, over time, the distribution patterns of pottery may give some indication about manuring at different periods. It is likely that many boundary stones were placed in these fields, as they were in all such systems, but it is equally likely that these would have been simple rough boulders and thus not easily spotted in the modern urban environment. The fields will have contained a variety of other structures, besides soil platforms. All open field systems contained ephemeral sheds for shelter and the storage of tools, as well as earthwork and timber structures to support stands for peas and beans etc. and the locations of such features may come to light during development work within this RAZ. It will be instructive to compare all archaeological results from these two field systems with those from the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s own field system (RAZ 9.9.1). Differences in fertility and cropping practice may be detectable and might illustrate differences presumed to exist between an open field system managed by a city council and those managed by manorial courts.",Summary,The RAZ is intended to include the whole area of the field systems of both villages which falls within the modern city boundary. The remaining western boundary of the RAZ is formed by the line of the Nettleham Mere (RAZ 9.45.6).,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.9.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.9.2,

683b38a1-bb09-468b-8436-ccd5e10f728d,LARA RAZ AREA,,Holy Trinity Greestone Stairs,"This church, the most northerly in the suburb of Butwerk, was sited on a terrace cut into the foot of the cliff north-west of the junction between Holgate, Greestone Stairs and Pottergate. It stood in the north-west angle between Greestone Stairs and Paradise Lane (also called Turn Again Lane which was approximately on the site of modern Temple Gardens). So far up the hill-side and sited on an awkward terrace, it may be best to think of this church as one founded relatively late in the sequence of churches in Butwerk. We might think a foundation date in the 11th century more realistic than one in the 10th. Its parochial population might have been largely artisans, as the Pottergate pottery kilns are ranged along the cliff-foot below the church site, and Holgate was at least partly within the parish (Hill 1948, 362). It is possible, indeed, that the terrace on which the church was built was itself a clay quarry. Future work should focus on these interesting aspects of the church's foundation. Its graveyard population may therefore provide an interesting comparison with those from some of the known ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáelite‰Û¡ÌÝå» churches (such as, for example, St Andrew Wigford - RAZ 9.60.19). The church is known to have housed an anchorite from the late 14th century (ed. Foster 1914, 67 - Venables 1887-8, 336-7) and, as archaeological evidence for such cells is rare, information about this aspect of church use would be welcome.",Summary,"The church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s location is approximately known, and burials have been discovered during works here (eg. London, Soc. Of Ants Ms.786, V, 15-6).

68ce3885-fecb-487c-82a8-f438fc5550c3,LARA RAZ AREA,,Valley floor deposits,"In the Prehistoric Era, as in all of the others which follow, one of the most important and informative archaeological deposits in the city is the large area of peat which fills the valley floor below the 5m contour. It is rich in waterlogged deposits which will allow us to tell more clearly than individual excavations how the landscape of the river valley developed and how that development was affected by human action. Although some systematic research work was undertaken in connection with the construction of certain university buildings, a long-term and coherent research programme of collating and collecting bore-hole data is essential and should be a high priority for the City Archaeologist. At present we have only the sketchiest idea of the complex developments which have resulted in the riparian topography. We need to know where the channels of the river have been at various dates. What was the date and sequence of flooding which resulted in the build up of the peat deposits? Where were the sand islands which were left isolated during these inundation episodes? The island of Hartsholme, for example, remains to plotted archaeologically. In the Prehistoric Era particularly, but continuing right up into the High Medieval Era, votive deposits have been made in the area of pools and meres which formed in the wetland landscape brought about by the late Bronze Age inundation. Amongst these the metalwork finds have received all the attention to date, and further finds of this type should be expected anywhere within RAZ 5.8, but especially in the area around the Stamp End causeway (RAZ 5.2). Excavations at Flag Fen (Pryor 1991) have shown, however, that offerings of many different types were made at these sites, and we must also plot finds of bones (animal and human), wood, textile and leather to obtain a satisfactory impression of the rituals being enacted here.",Summary,The boundaries of the RAZ are drawn to include all the land thought to have been below the 5m contour in historic or Prehistoric times.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,5.8,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,5.8,

69121ff4-620b-445f-a39d-333d487a6826,LARA RAZ AREA,,The Racecourse,"The racecourse was itself a product of the enclosure movement, which impeded the informal courses run hitherto on the heath north and south of the city. In 1773 a permanent course was established on the West Common by the Council, who persuaded the local aristocracy to pay the costs of construction and maintenance (Hill 1966, 17). Patrons were not persuaded to pay for the stand until 1806, but according to Saunders it was not erected until 1827 (1834, 207). The buried remains of this structure, evidently located to the west of the existing stand, and shown on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map as well as on early photographs, will be of rarity and interest. The surviving stand of 1897 (architect William Mortimer and Son) is still one of the earliest and most important structures of this type still usable in the country. The original uses to which the chambers below the raised standing were put should be comprehensible through recording projects undertaken in conjunction with repairs and alterations. A research agenda for such structures is currently in production (Wood forthcoming). The stand served as a mess and administration building when the racecourse was converted into an aerodrome during the First World War (RAZ 11.85.1). The archaeology of racecourses themselves is little known. The survival of the entire course at Lincoln makes it an exceptionally complete example, and the final prepared course is visible as an earthwork, which should be surveyed as a priority. It is not known whether Lincoln races were run over a prepared track in the 18th century - and sections cut across the course might provide information on this point. Similarly little is known about equipment at the starting or finishing line and excavations here might cast some light on the matter.",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the boundaries depicted on the 1st edition O.S. map and includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.77,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.77,

6a1e21be-a18e-4f11-8a04-289418ca2dc4,LARA RAZ AREA,,Lincoln Castle from the mid-12th century,"As well as the forthcoming volume dedicated to the site (ed. Lindley forthcoming), a Conservation Plan has been produced for Lincoln Castle (Hayfield 2000) and this provides a much more detailed research agenda than is possible here. Dr Hayfield‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work was undertaken, however, without the benefit of the information on the early Norman castle and consequently the following supplementary information is provided to help guide future archaeological planning. The castle founded in 1068 included the whole of the upper city and a research agenda for this initial phase is considered under RAZ 9.47. Sometime around the year 1100, however, the decision was taken to create a smaller, more compact, castle in one corner of the upper city and this decision must have had some preliminary archaeological consequences. It is no longer thought likely that the 166 houses of Domesday were anything more than an estimate of taxable value of the land on which the castle stood, so we should probably not expect to find a demolished quarter of the town, cleared for the castle site. But it remains the case that we don‰Û¡ÌÝå»t know what we would expect. The castle rampart encloses the best-preserved archaeology of Anglo-Scandinavian Lincoln and the debate about the character of the pre-Norman upper city (whether it was essentially a reserved enclosure, or whether it was a second trading centre like the one downhill) will be answered most effectively by well-targeted excavations here. Excavations at the west gate have shown that the new smaller castle enclosure was not begun until around 1100, but we are seriously short of evidence for the sequence of events and the time-scale involved. A probable sequence of construction of the ramparts and walls has been proposed by Dr Vince, but this sequence needs corroboration in the form of a more detailed study of the castle earthworks, focusing especially on differences in structure between west, north and east banks. Sections across the earthworks would also be extremely helpful, if carefully sited, and may provide the conclusive evidence for date and sequence which is still awaited. Ditch fills may also provide some valuable information, although they have been subject to repeated clearance. On the south side, particularly, the complex relationship between the Lucy Tower motte, the Roman wall which preceded it and the later curtains which incorporated it, should be comprehensible at a few key points in back gardens where the three feature are overlain. Targeted work at such points might reveal important information at relatively little expense. The point has already been made (RAZ 9.47) that excavations in the platform of the Lucy Tower motte itself will be of great importance in addressing the issue of the early Norman castle, but such work will also be of great significance in understanding the 12th-century building, which remains unexplained at present.As Dr Vince has explained (chapter 9a), the Castle has a complex sequence of development from the 12th century to the mid 13th century, and a research agenda for this period is provided in Dr Hayfield‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Conservation Plan.",Summary,The RAZ boundaries are drawn around the outer edges of the castle ditch - which follows roads in the modern street pattern.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.48,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.48,

6a28d115-f4f3-4b61-b51c-ad6fe67d9127,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,St. Botolph's Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSt. Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Character Area is located at the base of the River Witham valley and is dominated by High Street, a former Roman road and still the historic entranceway to the southern part of the city. The Character Area runs from the medieval watercourse of Sincil Dyke in the south to Ashton‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Court in the north, and is defined by the plots of properties fronting on to each side of High Street.Many historical features remain visible in the current townscape including the alignment of High Street itself, which follows the approximate route of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáFosse Way‰Û¡ÌÝå», a Roman Military [60-90 AD] road. The course of medieval burgage plots is often preserved in the orientation of building plots and roads off High Street, and the boundaries of a former medieval market may be preserved in the orientation of building frontages and rear garden boundaries of terraces in the south of the Character Area.High Street is a busy dual carriageway carrying a high level of traffic, and is a well-used commercial centre for generally independently-run businesses. The function of properties varies along High Street resulting in a sense of activity throughout much of the day. Roads of mainly Late Victorian/Edwardian date frequently run off both sides of High Street, including many cul-de-sacs constrained by Sincil Dyke to the east or the River Witham to the west. Junctions between High Street and roads that bridge the watercourses are more prominent, and carry higher levels of traffic.Urban blocks in the Character Area are mostly small, allowing good movement to the east and west, as well as north/south along High Street. Modern buildings usually occupy large square plots, in contrast to Late Victorian/Edwardian buildings which are predominantly built within smaller rectangular plots with their short sides parallel to High Street.Building density is high, with buildings facing High Street mostly set at the back of the footway and occupying the full width of the front of their plots. However, modern properties are often set back from the road and several have no frontage onto High St. Buildings of Late Victorian/Edwardian date predominate and form a more consistent line along High Street than modern properties, producing a stepped but generally continuous building line that illustrates the plot-by-plot development and redevelopment of properties along High Street. Development plots vary from individual two-bay width houses to continuous runs of terraces and large properties of multiple-bay width, which occasionally span entire blocks.High Street is comparatively wider than in the neighbouring St. Peter at Gowt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Character Area, and as a result has a more spacious sense of enclosure along the majority of its length. Despite considerable variation in building form, style, and function, properties share many common elements key to the character of the area. Buildings have active frontages facing the street, and are two to three storeys in height, except for a limited number of single-storey buildings dating to the Modern Period. Rooflines are mainly orientated parallel to the street. Properties are built of small-scale materials, mostly in brick. At ground-floor level, buildings have large horizontal windows and glazed doors within shop frontages. In contrast, first and second floors have vertical, mainly wooden sash windows. Solid-to-void ratio increases with height, with comparatively smaller windows at second-floor level than at first.Shop frontages are a key characteristic of St. Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Character Area. They show great variation in form and style, and show a high degree of modification illustrating the ebb and flow of commercial activity along High Street from the Early Industrial Period to the modern day. Frontages are narrow, set within individual terraced buildings or incorporated within larger properties subdivided into smaller retail units.Many buildings along High Street have been converted from residential houses or industrial premises, a pattern which is particularly evident where shop fronts have been built out towards High Street over former front yards.Roofs are mostly gabled and vary in pitch, and are generally orientated with their rooflines parallel to the street. Roof materials are mainly slate, concrete tile or pantile. A number of properties, in particular those bordering a junction, have projecting gabled ends which face High Street and occasionally extend to ridgeline height at either end of the buildings. In addition, many properties on the west side of High Street have substantial gabled dormers set at the front of the buildings, several of which have finely decorative bargeboards and finials.Corner buildings are often taller in height or have their gables facing the street. Doors on corner properties are frequently set into the corner, either underneath chamfered or rounded faÌÎå_ades, or beneath projecting corners at first-floor level.Residential dwellings include some surviving Late Victorian/Edwardian terraces, a Modern public housing development in the form of a court (which replaced an Early Industrial Court), and large Modern private apartment blocks. A single commercial property at 408 High Street has been converted back to residential use.The Character Area includes a small number of civic buildings, such as St. Peter at Gowt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s School, St. Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Church and South Bar Congregational Chapel.

6b51b7e9-d6fa-4bea-b7db-b027b1f7b285,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Swithin (new site),"For a considerable there must have been great pressure to replace the crude little building on the original St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s site (RAZ 11.91.15) before a new church was finally commissioned from James Fowler of Louth and built in three stages, 1869-71, 1879-80 and 1884-7. It is said that the design he produced is his finest church building (Pevsner and Harris 1989, 500). The building was constructed on the northern half of the former Sheep Market and is certainly more ambitious, in its ground plan and in its lavish architectural decoration, than any of the other 19th-century churches in the city. Yet the manner in which its details deliberately recall originals at the Cathedral recognises the seniority of the Minster church. The plan of the building, along with its architectural details and fittings, represented the state of doctrinal thinking at the height of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s industrial prosperity. Fowler's own doctrinal position and the extent to which it influenced his architecture has been considered in Kaye et al. 1992. Consequently, archaeological recording should be undertaken in conjunction with repair and alteration and should be aimed at comparing such details at St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s with similar details from the extended medieval churches and with contemporary new buildings, like St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Canwick Road (RAZ 11.92.2). In this way we can chart how thinking on the great doctrinal issues of the day were being handled by different faith communities. The final stage of work here, the great stone spire of 1884-7, was built with money given by Alfred Shuttleworth in memory of his father, Joseph. The magnificent design is derived from the parish church at Louth. The parish had not only outgrown the original parish church, but it rapidly outgrew the burial ground also. Consequently, in the late 1840s, an ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáover-spill‰Û¡ÌÝå» graveyard was opened on the corner of Croft Street and Rosemary Lane (Hill 1974, 159) and this will represent a particularly useful population representing only about half a century of burials (it was closed in 1899 - Hill 1974, 160n). By comparing burials from this graveyard with those from earlier graveyards across the city, we will be able to assess whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered deterioration in their circumstances. Many graveyard memorials of the Industrial Era survive and it is important that the inscriptions they carry are recorded before they become illegible.",Summary,The RAZ includes the church plot and the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoverspill‰Û¡ÌÝå» graveyard mapped on the 2nd edition O.S. map.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.92.8,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.92.8,

But, despite its long-lived name, other judicial sentences besides trial by combat were undertaken (cf. the area's alternative name found in the 15th-century Pelours Place - i.e. the place of appeal - Cameron 1985, 32-3). The Castle gallows were one such judicial use, but by 1608 (at the latest) the site of the gallows had moved into a plot on the north side of Cliffgate, between Bradegate and the city ditch (Hill 1945, 99). The archaeology of this unusual arena has not been properly explained, despite extensive investigations in the 1980s (LH84, L86), and any features which can be related to its continuing judicial use in the Early Modern Era will be of great value. As a place of execution, one might expect burials here, but, although many burials were found during excavations, they were all thought to belong to the adjacent church of St Bartholomew. It is possible, of course, that St Bartholomew's chapel continued to play the role of burial ground to the gallows into the 18th century (RAZ 10.57, 10.60.3) The arena was shown as an earthwork in Stukeley's map of 1722.",Summary,"The RAZ is defined as the space left unoccupied between the mills along the cliff edge (RAZ 10.43) and the western lip of the castle west ditch (RAZ 10.48).

North of the line of Cliffgate, the Early Modern RAZ occupies an area which was presumed to have been dedicated to suburban building in the High Medieval Era, but which was apparently now vacant. It is this plot which contained the 17th-century gallows but they may have been moved there at the start of the Era.

6d77f17c-06ae-45c4-a280-d96f19aa872b,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Eastgate Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌEastgate Character Area is a residential area located immediately outside of the former east gate of the upper Roman and Medieval city. The area has a complex townscape influenced by the full spectrum of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s evolution since its foundation in the Roman Military Period.The area has a loose grid pattern of Roman and Medieval streets that converge on the former east gate of the Roman and Medieval cities. The funnelling of streets reflects the shape of a former High Medieval market in the area. Roads are well connected to the east and west carrying high volumes of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, retaining its historic status as one of the main entrances to the city. However, there is poor connectivity to the south and north as result of the strong boundary formed by the High Medieval Close Wall and plots of large-scale houses respectively.There is an observable pattern in the townscape from east to west. Properties increase in age towards the west, and this is accompanied by the more frequent use of stone and other ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátraditional‰Û¡ÌÝå» materials. There is a relative increase in building scale, and smaller and mostly individual build units lead to complex and varied building lines. Buildings are also set at the back of the footway. The east-to-west pattern creates a sense of arrival when entering the city, which is heightened by the terminating view of the cathedral towers and the converging of streets onto the former east gate.Properties throughout have doors and windows facing out onto the street, creating a feeling of activity and security along the street, although tall walls lead to a high sense of enclosure and feeling of insecurity in parts.Several buildings survive from the Early Modern Era, mainly in the west of the area. However, there are a handful of similar buildings and features in the east, which help to develop more of a transition between western and eastern parts of the Character Area.Eastern and central parts of the area are dominated by Late Victorian/Edwardian houses which mostly consist of small rows of terraced houses as well as a small number of semi-detached and detached houses. The properties introduce a greater regularity of scale and form, and style, leading to a finer grain of buildings and plots, and a more regular townscape character.Buildings dating to the Post-War and Modern Periods are mostly located in the far east of the area and are comparably more varied in form, although within build units properties are highly coherent. Properties are often constructed of modern materials and incorporate features that try to imitate earlier ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátraditional‰Û¡ÌÝå» features. The buildings have a strong emphasis on the incorporation of car parking into developments with properties blanked off at first-floor level or built around cul-de-sacs or courtyards. This often leads to inactive frontages in many parts of the area.A considerable amount of public realm survives from the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period and earlier, complementing the medieval pattern of streets and building plots in the area.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 94,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,25,

6df2a116-dc86-43c8-9c13-4beb4cf5dcab,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Steep Hill and The Strait Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSteep Hill and The Strait Character Area is a complex townscape, the evolution of which has been influenced by the development of Lincoln since it was first established in the Roman Military Era. Many traces of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s development over two thousand years are visible within the current townscape, particularly those associated with growth and expansion during the High Medieval and Post-Railway Expansion Periods. The medieval buildings in this and neighbouring Character Areas are part of a nationally recognised group of residential and commercial medieval buildings.The Character Area is located on the steepest section of the north escarpment and is an umbilical connecting the lower and upper parts of the city of Lincoln. As well as influencing the built form and layout of the townscape, the steepness of the escarpment slope is a key element of any visit to the Character Area, increasing the depth and complexity of views up the slope, whilst providing more open and long ranging outlooks to the south.A high density of commercial and residential properties is arranged around an irregular grid of narrow streets, the pattern of which derives from a medieval layout of market streets which converged on the former south gate of the upper Roman Colonia. Strong building lines are composed of rows of small or individual build units. Properties vary in form, style and construction, resulting in a changing character when moving through the area.The form, style and construction of properties within building lines are variable, illustrating the complex history of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s development and redevelopment. However, buildings throughout the area have many broadly consistent characteristics such as scale, decoration, construction materials, solid-to-void ratio, and relationship to the street. There is a high density of buildings in the area, the majority of which are two and a half to three storeys in height and two bays in width. Buildings are set at the back of the footway and have active frontages facing the street leading to a strong sense of enclosure accompanied by a feeling of activity and security. Traditional materials (e.g. stone, brick and wood) are used throughout the vast majority of the townscape, both in buildings as well as in the public realm. The common use of generally small-scale traditional materials is a unifying aspect of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s character. Many buildings along The Strait and Steep Hill have small/narrow shopfronts built of wood in a variety of loosely classical styles, although some simply consist of enlarged or standard windows.Buildings either side of Steep Hill and The Strait mostly consist of short rows of Late Victorian/Edwardian residential houses constructed in small build units of between one and five properties. Consequently, building lines are varied, although comparably less so than along The Strait and Steep Hill.Throughout the area there are views of complex roofscapes from the streets. The rise and fall of the slope and the Cathedral exacerbate the vertical emphasis of the townscape. Views of the Cathedral contribute greatly to the townscape character, and serve to reinforce the rich cultural heritage of the area, and the historic context of the largely medieval townscape, emphasising the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s connection with the townscape to the north. There are distinctive views from the north escarpment towards the south, including views over lower parts of the city, in addition to more long ranging views of South Common and Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s rural hinterland.The majority of the buildings appear to be in good condition, although some shops are vacant and occasionally neglected. Although structurally sound, many houses show signs of settlement and repair, emphasising the ancient nature of the townscape‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 1,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,38,

6e822728-5060-4461-9490-cfcc23868044,LARA RAZ AREA,,St George,"Like several other churches in peripheral locations St George seems to have been a relatively minor church. By 1428 the parish had fewer than 10 inhabitants and this is the latest reference we have to its existence (Hill 1948, 287). Major thought it had been absorbed into St Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish before 1461 (ed. Major 1958, vi), but by 1616 it had become part of St Swithin (Cameron 1985, 122). Such simple churches can often be as revealing about medieval piety as the much grander buildings and the way in which ritual was managed within a limited space is of great interest, especially as this church plainly disappeared before the changes in liturgy ushered in by the Reformation. The church was the home of the Guild of St George (founded 1377 - Westlake 1919, 170) and the guild‰Û¡ÌÝå»s liturgical arrangements should be sought out in future archaeological work. It may be that the guild came to dominate liturgy here after the parish had been had been united with St Michael but, alternatively, the church might have continued as a chapel of ease, much like its neighbour, St Andrew, or it might have been demolished - as Venables thought likely (1887-8, 340). The answers to these questions can only be addressed archaeologically.The churchyard population is also likely to be of interest as it will represent a more marginal group, presumably dominated by the lower orders of society, although we have no evidence that it continued in use after the absorption of the parish into St Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. Potentially this implies a useful sealed population of 15th-century and earlier date and, as a group, it will provide valuable evidence for the types of people who lived in back-street settlements such as that revealed in excavations at Flaxengate (F72). It will also provide an interesting contrast with the more wealthy populations of parishes such as St Lawrence (RAZ 10.60.38) or St Martin (RAZ 10.60.39).",Summary,"The site of the churchyard is known. It was bounded by Grantham Street to the south and Danes Terrace to the east. To the west it was probably originally set out along the original Flaxengate frontage (well to the west of the modern street line), but this street frontage may have been encroached on and the church closed off from the street at an early date. This also means that the original churchyard is likely to extend below the modern street of Flaxengate and works here should be subject to archaeological investigation. The northern boundary is uncertain and an arbitrary line has been chosen.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.40,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.40,

Instead it was probably the church which served what seems to have been the bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s manorial enclosure at Willingthorpe (RAZ 9.32.1). The date of its foundation will be of considerable interest, as its foundation may reflect the increase in interest in Lincoln by the bishop following the Conquest. As with the manorial enclosure more widely, the research agenda for the church will rely, at least in part, on those produced for village, rather than urban, churches. Such agendas can be found in Blair and Pyrah 1996 and in Morris 1989. Even so, the relationship of the church to the city is of interest. Our current understanding suggests that the manor of Willingthorpe became engulfed by the spread of the Newland suburb and it will be a matter of great interest if this process can be understood in the physical remains of the church, or in the character of its graveyard population. Did the church expand or reduce in size as the surrounding population became suburban rather than manorial? Is any change in the graveyard population visible which matches this apparent change in status? The development of St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s could be profitably compared with any of the more conventional city churches, but it will be particularly interesting to compare its development with St Stephen‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (RAZ 9.60.14), as this church stands in the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásenior‰Û¡ÌÝå» position in the suburb, just outside the gate.",Summary,"The general location of the church is known, but the enclosure which has been identified between Newland Street West, Charles Street West, South Parade and West Parade is likely to represent the whole curia of the manor and not just the churchyard. This RAZ, therefore has the same boundaries as RAZ 9.32.1. Mr Johnson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s researches amongst the later documents for the area have suggested to him that the churchyard itself may have been in the north-west corner of this site (pers. com.).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.15,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.15,

There should be some documentation for the market surviving in the copious Duchy papers and these should be searched for documentary information. The fact that the market did not survive long after the abolition of the separate jurisdiction of the Bail following the Municipal Reform Act of 1835, however, suggests that a market uphill did not form part of the new mercantile Council‰Û¡ÌÝå»s plans. The archaeological evidence for its decline will be of interest and may cast further light on the question of whether the market was still viable when it was closed, and therefore whether its closure was more of an economic or a political act.",Summary,"The RAZ for the market includes the broad street itself, with the intention of managing deposits and structures related to the market itself.

6f8fabcc-2a77-4770-94c8-df9db40cec8a,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Radial Roads Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe majority of North Lincoln Ribbon Development Character Area is composed of residential development built for the middle classes during the Inter-War Period. Nonetheless, housing in the area illustrates nearly a full spectrum of the construction of housing along some of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s major roads from the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period to the modern day.The backbone of the Character Area is formed by the four main radial roads in the north of Lincoln, alongside connecting roads which form a circular route around the settlement‰Û¡ÌÝå»s historic core. The radial roads, which emanate from the historic core of the city, have connected Lincoln with its hinterland since the Roman Military Era.Properties along roads in the Character Area are mostly semi-detached and detached houses dating to the Inter-War Period. Late Victorian/Edwardian properties, mostly in the form of terraced rows, are located more towards the city centre, whereas Modern development is more sporadic and dispersed.Much of the townscape has a coherent character. The majority of properties are two storeys in height and two bays in width, and are consistently set back in straight building lines arranged parallel to the street. Houses face the road, creating a feeling of security and activity along streets, and are set towards the front of spacious rectangular plots aligned perpendicularly to the road. The common direction of plots and their relatively consistent dimensions create a regular grain throughout the area. There is a medium-to-high density of buildings, resulting in mostly continuous building lines and a consistent sense of enclosure along streets, which is often heightened by mature trees along roads and tall borders along plot boundaries. Public/private boundaries to the front are often demarked by privet hedging, and roads have grass verges and/or trees, generating a coherent feeling between streets in the area. The majority of Inter-War properties have driveways and/or garages illustrating the increased use of the private motor-car during the early-mid 20th century.Properties are built of brick and other small-scale materials, and are often very similar in form and construction. Houses are rectangular in plan and often have a projecting wing or bay window to the front faÌÎå_ade. Properties are mostly differentiated through the incorporation of various decorations, which in many cases illustrates the ability of prospective owners to choose decorative elements of their buildings when ‰Û¡ÌÝÌábuying off plan‰Û¡ÌÝå». Late Victorian/Edwardian terraced houses are generally more prominent where facing a main road, reflecting the status of the roads during the period. Properties of this type are set back from the footway with small forecourts and have comparatively more decoration than other terraced houses, which are set at the back of the footway and are plainer in character.Open space in the area is limited, and is mainly composed of the main and connecting roads, and allotments either side of Yarborough Crescent. The allotment sites are well used and a valued asset to residents.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 47,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,8,

6fb17938-ee85-4354-b80d-a91bfdbbf813,LARA RAZ AREA,,Holy Innocents,"This church has a character which is both complex and little understood. It clearly was a parish church, but the fact that it became part of the Malandry Leper Hospital (RAZ 9.56) during the early 12th century suggests that it was in a somewhat special situation. It seems likely that it already existed before the Malandry was founded and so it was presumably founded as the most southerly of several churches located to cater for the great new funnel-shaped market of Lower Wigford. As we do not know its precise location we cannot tell whether it was founded along the edge of the market space, or whether it was established in the centre of the green (like St John Newport (RAZ 9.60.1) and St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Eastgate (RAZ 9.60.6)). In either case, however, it seems unlikely that the church would be older than the market place and therefore the foundation date of the church might help to identify the date at which the market itself was laid out. The dedication is unlikely to be an early one, but it may suggest that the church originally had some relationship with St Sepulchre‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hospital on the other side of Swine Green, because from the 14th century at least St Sepulchre catered primarily for children. The takeover of Holy Innocents by the Malandry is comparable with the takeover of the former parish churches of St Giles (RAZ 9.60.7) and St Bartholomew (RAZ 9.60.3) by hospitals in the 13th century, but in this instance the adoption of the church by the hospital was markedly earlier. As well as its date, any structural changes marking this conversion will be of great interest, and understanding such changes might require total excavation of the church fabric. The graveyard too will be of exceptional interest, not only because (if it was not swept away by the Lincoln-Grantham railway line) it will be well preserved, but because it offers the comparison between a secular population and the subsequent population dependent on the hospital. It is not clear, however, whether the hospital inmates were buried in the parochial graveyard, or whether they were segregated. Either arrangement would merit exploration and, if there were distinct graveyards for the hospital inmates and the parishioners, the two graveyard populations should be compared.",Summary,"It is clear that Holy Innocents was located within the Malandry precinct, (RAZ 9.56), but, although burials were discovered when the railway line was put through the southern part of the precinct (Brooks 1934-5, 178), it is not known whether they represented the parochial burial ground. The RAZ, therefore, is coterminous with RAZ 9.56.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.17,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.17,

6ffc1759-e461-4cea-a71a-34d64314c76a,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Hartsholme Park Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThis Character Area is a country park with a large lake, lawn, woods, grassland and many paths. It is well used for recreation, with a visitor centre, cafÌÎå©, caravan park, parking area, play area and playing fields. The lake (especially near the new ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáheritage‰Û¡ÌÝå» railings), cafÌÎå©, visitor centre and nearby play area provide a focal point. This is also the location of the former 19th-century Hartsholme Hall, traces of which can still be seen in the landscape. Surviving landscape elements include many features relating to the Hall such as the lake, stables, boathouse, statues, and gardens. Surviving aspects of the formal planted gardens of the Hall include the yew trees of the ladies‰Û¡ÌÝå» walk and dense woodland around the lake with many trees of both native and imported varieties. The current character is also influenced by features relating to the draining of the wetlands and the development of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s water supply in the 19th century such as the reservoir (now the lake) and drainage channels. The line of the medieval road between Boultham and Skellingthorpe, now Skellingthorpe Road, is also visible in some places.In addition to the woodland around the lake, there are other areas of woodland that include birch, oak and willow trees. Further south there are areas of acidic grassland, for example in ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáThe Meadow‰Û¡ÌÝå». A variety of wetland species line the edge of the lake, the dykes and other damp areas.This is a key green space and recreational facility for the city, especially for residents in the neighbouring areas of Hartsholme to the east and Birchwood to the west. Good pedestrian access is provided to these residential areas and there is vehicle and public transport access from the rest of the city is via Skellingthorpe Road.Together with Swanholme Lakes to the south and the Skewbridge Character Area to the north, Hartsholme Park forms part of an important continuous area of green space stretching from the southern city boundary to the northern boundary, also taking in Burton Fields, Boultham Mere and West Common. Within the site there are important views both across and around the lake. The nearby high-rise apartment block, Jarvis House, is visible from several places in the Park.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 17,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,87,

71112f36-6eef-412d-9325-f07fcb9aae37,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Burton Ridge Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌBurton Ridge is an open area of land along the north escarpment, which, along with West Common to the south and Burton Fields to the north west, forms part of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s western rural fringe. The area is a conspicuous feature on the north escarpment and benefits from good views across the Witham Gap and towards the Trent Vale.The Character Area is bordered by the backs of residential properties and light industry along the base and summit of the escarpment, the A46 to the north and Yarborough and Long Leys Road to the south.The area contains a number of traces of former land use, most notably earthworks associated with former brickworks and a rectilinear pattern of field divisions resulting from the enclosure of common land during the early 19th century.Much of the Character Area consists of scrubland, grassland or woodland, and appears to receive little or no regular management, although a small part of the site is designated as a nature reserve. The area includes a small public park in the south, and a number of allotments along the escarpment summit towards the centre of the area. A number of the rear plots of Inter-War houses bordering the allotments have access to the gardens via small gateways.Northern parts of the Character Area are more rural in character, with boundaries defined by thin hawthorn hedging with frequent mature trees, merging relatively seamlessly with the rural landscape beyond. Mature trees are more prevalent both within wooded edges and freestanding in open space in the north, and are associated with informal parkland within the former shooting/hunting estate of Burton Hall.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 41,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,9,

71c9e5a0-a604-4aa2-8cdb-5b38f603d1c2,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Bartholomew Westcastle,"The parish church on the site of St Bartholomew seems to have only survived from its foundation until 1295, at which date the first steps were taken to convert it from its parochial role into the Leper Hospital, which subsequently occupied the site (RAZ 9.57). The parochial responsibilities were not extinguished, however, and it seems that St Bartholomew became a church like those of St Giles (RAZ 9.60.7) and Holy Innocents (RAZ 9.60.17), which were within hospitals, but which retained some parochial rights. The lack of documents relating to the late medieval parish is probably not due to the church having lost these rights, but to the fact that there were no parishioners in the parish. The church itself was probably not founded before the end of the 11th century, as Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s studies of the pottery from this suburb suggests that occupation here did not occur until that date at the earliest (chapter 9a). At that time it was presumably a rectilinear plot bounded by the road to the north, the Battle Place or a similar open space to the south and by suburban houses to east and west. The houses had probably gone by the time the hospital was founded and so, in its hospital phase, the churchyard could have expanded to east and west. In its original site, however, St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s was in a similar position relative to the upper city gate to that of St Nicholas Newport (RAZ 9.60.2), St Peter Eastgate (RAZ 9.60.4) and St Michael-on-the-Mount (RAZ 9.60.33). Like these churches, it might have been founded at a similar date, near the start of the town. Any change over in the physical characteristics of the graveyard population which could be associated with the conversion from parochial to hospital use would be of great interest, especially as we can make certain sociological assumptions about the hospital inmates, based on our knowledge that they had all been associated with the Cathedral.",Summary,"The site of the church is known and the RAZ is drawn to include the same area as the hospital (RAZ 9.57) as it is not possible to provide any more accurate location at this stage for the boundary of the parochial, as opposed to the hospital graveyard.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.3,

Any evidence for either would be valuable. Maintaining the routeway, for example, might imply a continuing ritual role for the Stamp End causeway, whereas its abandonment might suggest a shift in ritual emphasis.",Summary,"The boundaries of this RAZ were established in Chapter 5a and are dictated purely by the notional location of the causeway itself. Although the road or track is unlikely to be more than a few metres wide, the fact that its location is unknown means that a broad strip about 100m wide to the east of the formerly waterlogged ground has been designated. The northern boundary of the RAZ is formed by the original southern extent of waterlogged land.

726b52bd-fb89-4f47-990e-dcf8b36731ba,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Margaret Pottergate,"St Margaret Pottergate is another church for which we have slightly earlier evidence than is the norm in Lincoln. It clearly existed before 1114 when it was confirmed to the Cathedral, having been gifted to it previously by one Osbert the Sheriff, who may also have been known as Osbern the priest (ed. Foster 1931, 22, RA 24; Hill 1948, 50). It is therefore, one of a number of known proprietary church foundations in the city. Osbert was sheriff of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire in the last years of the 11th century, and the plaque recovered from its graveyard recording Siford the priest of the church has been dated to the same period (chapter 9a). The church occupies an interesting location. We can presume that, originally, it occupied the whole plot between Boune Lane and Pottergate, but it seems that houses were built in its churchyard by the 12th century (Jones et al. 1987, 4) and, as the church was located towards the western end of the plot, these were probably along the Pottergate street frontage. Being sealed in the 12th century, the burial population in this eastern part of the cemetery will be of particular value as a relatively closely dated population. By the later medieval period (following the construction of the Angel Choir in 1255-80) St Margaret‰Û¡ÌÝå»s lay south of an important route from Pottergate along the south side of the Minster, but it is important that we establish how ancient this route was. One argument has suggested that the route was created in order to communicate with the gate through the castle wall, which the Bishop was licensed to make between 1100 and 1115 (ed. Foster 1931, 20-1, RA21) (chapter 9a; Stocker forthcoming a). This would mean that the church was older than the though-route, but it is likely that paths through the churchyard would still have provided access from Pottergate to Boune Lane.",Summary,"The location of the cemetery is known and was open for use until the 19th century. The RAZ is drawn around the known boundaries of the cemetery, including the frontage on Pottergate, which is presumed to have been taken out of cemetery use in the 12th century and replaced by dwellings. The north-eastern corner of the cemetery has probably been lost to road widening and it is possible that deeper interments survive under the pavement and road here.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.5,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.5,

736e006f-8e52-407d-a64c-710a9ca60055,LARA RAZ AREA,,Temple complexes in the lower city,"The evidence for the temple complex at the foot of the hill inside the south gate of the lower city has been set out by Mr Jones in chapter 7a. There is good evidence (reported by Mr Jones) that the complex was focused on a large fountain. As with the Late Iron Age sacred pool, and as with the forum in the upper city, once again water was at the centre of celebrations at this ritual site. Mr Jones suggests that the pipe discovered by Richmond at Greestone Stairs might have supplied the water for the fountain, but one wonders whether a more potent symbolic point would have been made if the fountain had been supplied, either from the same source as the temple of the Imperial cult in the upper city, or from one of the (hypothetically sacred) springs and pools in the hillside itself. The interdependence of the commercial, domestic and the ritual, the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» and the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå», in the lower city is nicely illustrated by the apparent dedication, in part or whole, of this temple complex to Mercury - a cult associated, pre-eminently, with merchants (Henig 1984, 30). Mercury, the messenger of the gods, is also, however, 'hierophanies', (Bradley 2000, 28-32), a cthonic deity, that is to say he stands at the portal between heaven and earth and communicates between the two. Mercury played a similar role in the Roman world, therefore, to that we may presume was played by the pre-Roman deity associated with the sacred pool of the Iron Age. Typically, such pools are seen as the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáportals‰Û¡ÌÝå» between heaven and earth. Furthermore, in Germanic myth the gods who inhabit such places are, like Mercury, the messengers between man and the gods (Davidson 1993, 29.). A connection between Mercury and native water deities in the territory of the Corieltauvi may be demonstrated by finds at the cantonal capital Ratae Coritanorum of a sculpture possibly depicting a Romano-Celtic water deity not more than 150m from an inscription dedicated to Mercury (Todd 1991, 62; Huskison 1994, 7, No.13; 40, Nos 84-85). The paired churches which sat on this site in the Middle Ages, and which are suspected of being early foundations (e.g. Gem 1993), were dedicated to St Peter (RAZ 8.1.2). Rather than St Peter, St Michael is usually considered the Christian saint endowed with the characteristics of Mercury (Morris 1989, 56), but, holding the keys to the gates of heaven, St Peter is also a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáportal‰Û¡ÌÝå» saint and it is not inconceivable that a cult of Mercury would become christianised as a cult of St Peter.Mercury is also frequently associated with Mithraism (Henig 1984,107; Claus 2000, 158-60) and there is some evidence that there may have been a Mithraeum in this part of the settlement (Stocker 1997). The reorganisation of any sacred potency in the natural springs in the cliff face so that their power was transferred to a single temple complex, dedicated to the god of commerce, at the heart of the commercial settlement, speaks volumes for the pragmatic attitude taken by the Romans to religion. As in the upper city, there is little to distinguish the presumed advent of Christianity in these ritual sites in the 4th century. Like Mithraism, Christianity was also an exclusive cult in the 2nd - 4th centuries. It too was initially housed in ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» spaces (such as the rooms of the grand new ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» houses on the hill slope) and not at the sites of natural phenomena. With the official conversion of the Imperial cult in AD 314, the well-defined and well-regulated ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» spaces which had formerly been devoted to its cult would have been given a different iconography and perhaps different structures more suited to the requirements of the new rituals, but the larger archaeological signature of the religion remained unchanged. The new religion was housed in the same reserved ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» areas, as had been the old, and there is no evidence at all for the re-planning of the settlement to accommodate a new relationship between the citizens and their gods.It is possible,",Summary,"Although we suspect the presence of at least one other temple in the lower city or Wigford (the Mithraeum), the only temple actually located within the lower city so far is that at the foot of the hill just inside the south gate. At present we have insufficient evidence to reconstruct the plan of this complex, but we can presume that it will have been rectilinear in shape, and Mr Jones suggests that it may have extended as far north-east as the building found at F72 (chapter 7a). It is unclear whether Ermine Street passed through it (in the way that the principal east-west street is thought to have passed through the Forum), but this is a serious alternative and so the RAZ has been drawn to cover an equivalent area on the west side of the road as that defined to the east. If (as is suggested in RAZ 8.1.2 and 9.60.44) the twin churches of St Peter at Pleas and St Peter-at-Arches represent an early Christian reuse or adaptation of this temple enclosure, then it is likely that the southern boundary of the temple complex will have been the southern defences of the city itself. The enclosure, (or un-enclosed complex?) created by this exercise results in a RAZ some 150m x 250m, a larger area than occupied by the Forum complex in the upper city, and in its turn this must lead us to ask whether this area in the lower city is not a second Forum.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.2,

74d900ac-b59e-4009-8e6b-90f6f5316d85,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Birchwood Estate Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌBirchwood Estate Character Area is a large ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáself-contained‰Û¡ÌÝå» public housing development dating from between 1960 and 1980, with associated community centre and green space. It is located approximately 4km southwest of Lincoln city centre. Constructed in six phases (Birchwood 1-5 and a former RAF housing estate) over a short period of time, the varying development units making up the Character Area illustrate changing approaches towards the construction of large public housing estates in the latter part of the 20th century.On closer inspection the broadly coherent townscape of Birchwood Estate Character Area contains considerable variation, seen both in the original design and layout of each development phase, but also in small-scale details and particularly the subsequent personalisation of dwellings as properties passed from public to private ownership with the introduction of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáRight to Buy‰Û¡ÌÝå» scheme in 1980. The public housing developments have overwritten much of the former landscape, however the townscape contains many traces of its rural and military past, including the lines of field boundaries associated with the 18/19th century enclosure of land, boundaries of two probable 19th century woodland plantations, and the remains of a taxiway associated with a WWII heavy bomber airfield.Small-scale differences in the layout, form and decoration of housing have a significant impact on the townscape character, and define six phases of housing development between the late 1960‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and 1980‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. However, phases of development within the area have many shared characteristics. Residential housing is laid out around straight and curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs and closes, and consists with short rows of between 4 and 10 dwellings, and a small number of semi-detached houses. Buildings are mostly 2-storeys in height and are 2/3 bays in width, with the exception of 3 storey apartment blocks, which are 6-10 bays in width and are mainly located along the edges of housing developments bordering open space. Houses are plain in appearance and are built of small-scale materials, mostly birck, with shallow pitch gabled roofs covered in concrete tiles. Buildings have high solid to void ratios with regular but small UPVC casement windows. Buildings occupy the front or centre of their plots, and are set back 5-10m from the footway. The principal differences between Birchwood Phases are observable in the form, layout and the decoration of properties. The exterior decoration of houses varies, both in the original design of dwellings, but also as a result of increased personalisation after the introduction of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáRight to Buy‰Û¡ÌÝå» scheme in 1980. Public/private boundaries are commonly undefined, notably on houses that appear to be privately owned. The character of frontages varies, with changeable solid to void ratios and a mixture of inactive and active frontages facing the street. Urban block structure varies as a result of differing street layouts and the inconsistent inclusion and arrangement of public space within each phase. A key difference between estates is the setting and aspect of properties in relation to open space and road infrastructure. There are frequent and occasionally large areas of open space, both within and bordering residential developments, which mainly consists of areas of open grassland and greens with dispersed mature trees. Open space is found within individual phases, usually in the form of communal greens or areas around 3-storey apartment blocks, and on the edges of some phases in the form of large verges. A number of large open areas are grouped around the Birchwood Centre, but are poorly integrated with each other and surrounding residential areas, which turn their back on the space. Western edges of Birchwood Estate Character Area border, and have limited access to mature semi-natural woodland within Hospital Plantation Character Area.Birchwood Centre is located in the southeast of the area, and an important and well-used neighbourhood centre with small commercial shopping facilities and many public services Buildings are constructed from a variety of materials, and are located within individual plots rather than being integrated within, and arranged around, a central public space.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 30,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,78,

75611531-6380-4fb9-8b38-aa031e92953b,LARA RAZ AREA,,Brayford‰Û¡ÌÝå»s eastern waterside,"Both waterfronts of Brayford were rapidly developed as busy quaysides with warehouses following the re-establishment of the Fossdyke in 1744. Many of the warehouses built at this time were still standing in c.1945, although most have disappeared subsequently (Herridge 1999, Nos. 5499-5502). The buried remains of these warehouses are of archaeological interest as they offer an understanding of the diversity of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s trade, especially in the period prior to c.1850 when the waterways were the dominant trade route. The basic information about which warehouse dealt with which commodity may be comprehensible through documentary evidence, but the different plans of each warehouse will cast light on how the various commodities were treated. Changes in the layouts of the warehouses will hint at fluctuations in the trades in the different commodities over time, whilst through careful sampling it may be possible to say something about changes in the commodities themselves. It may also be possible to investigate whether there was any trade at the quayside itself, or was the marketing more strictly controlled so that goods were only sold through official outlets? Similarly, one crane is known from early views and it may be possible to say something about other dockside installations. Were further cranes or other machines employed or was loading and unloading done entirely by stevedores? If so, in what numbers? Some answers to these questions might be obtained from careful study of the surviving paving materials.The former Gilbert Blades Office, North Witham Bank (Herridge 1999, No.5000) still stands and although latterly a brush factory it is thought to have been an 18th-century warehouse. It is of brick and had a wharf to the west of building, with a river wall of brick. By 1823 the building was a brush making factory owned by Thomas Flint. The building may have been used as the printing works of L J and W J Harrison from 1928 to 1941, at least. (It is uncertain which building in North Witham Bank Harrisons occupied). It was used as Scouts‰Û¡ÌÝå» accommodation in the 1960s and converted to offices in 1975. All development work on this important survivor from the first period of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s industrial development must be accompanied by a full programme of recording.By the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, however, many warehouses around the Brayford seem to have changed character and had become food-processing buildings of one sort or another, particularly maltings and flour mills (RAZ 11.38). Presumably these changes reflect the dramatic changes brought about by the arrival of the railways and we should be investigating whether the changes from water-related canal warehousing to processing synchronise with the arrival of the railways. The last waterside structure on the East Wharf, Hercocks Banana Warehouse, was demolished as recently as 1993.Not all the buildings were warehouses, however, as Brayford Wharf East was also the site of Patterson's Silk Mill (RAZ 11.39).A comparison between the facilities on Brayford Wharf North and Brayford Wharf East will also be instructive - is it possible to say, for example, that one quayside was more likely to deal with imports and the other with exports?",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include the blocks of buildings fronting on to Brayford Wharf East as depicted on early mapping.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.2.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.2.1,

The defensive line was formed by designated houses and other structures, augmented at the points at which the line was breached by roads, by specially constructed anti-tank walls and other types of defensive barriers. It ran from the Fossdyke to the junction of Hewson Road and Carholme Road where the road was permanently narrowed by thickened walls and check-points - the narrow gap left could be closed off using temporary obstacles. Similar structures were provided across the other main entrances to the city. It then ran north-eastwards along the edge of the Racecourse (where a trench might have been excavated along the line of Alderman‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Walk) to the top of the hill at the Old Militia Barracks. From there it went north then east along Mill Road to the post office on Burton Road. Here the defences seem to have consisted mostly of temporary roadblocks, (including the temporary barriers of bent railway tracks known as 'hairpins') as they did at the junction of Williamson Street and Newport, and at the junction of The Grove with Nettleham Road and with Wragby Road. Along the eastern hillside, however, a large trench was dug through Foster‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Field behind the Monks Road School and the walls of Coldbath House were reinforced (Hurt 1991, 40-6). In Eastcliff Road, part of the boundary wall along the east side was rebuilt to provide loop-holes for rifle fire. To the south of the city the railway embankments were used as stop lines, from a point on the Market Rasen line at the east end of Winn Street to the embankment of the Avoiding Line east of the Power Station and Robey‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Works. The avoiding line provided a very solid obstacle across Wigford, with temporary defences across High Street. An anti-tank wall was built along the Witham between Dixon Street and the railway embankment to communicate with a road block on the Dixon Street bridge. There will be numerous standing and buried remains of this defensive circuit, which symbolises perfectly the popular mood of 1940, although a preliminary survey is urgently required to identify the standing remains. The standing and buried remains of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáwall‰Û¡ÌÝå» and its ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágates‰Û¡ÌÝå» should be recorded during works along its line and, as a complete monument, it should be compared with the quality of defences provided at other cities at this time.

By the time of the Enclosure Award of 1803 the roads to the north-west of the upper city had been replaced. Burton Road now followed a straight route ending at a square open area where the gallows stood at the end of Westgate. The line of windmills along the cliff edge, eight of which are shown on the Enclosure Award (RAZ 11.38), were served by Mill Road, which is, however, merely a formalisation of the southern end of Bradegate (chapter 9a). Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1819 shows the same arrangement as in the Enclosure Award, with all these new roads shown as being hedged. The only change is the presence of the Lunatic Asylum at the Lawn (RAZ 11.53). By 1857, the depot of the Royal North Lincolnshire Militia (RAZ 11.82) had been constructed on the corner of Burton Road and Upper Long Leys Road, and domestic housing had been constructed along Rasen Lane, the west side of Burton Road, south of Upper Long Leys Road, the east side of Mill Road, behind the militia depot and an area on the east of Burton Road, to either side of Mill Row (which led to another mill, not shown on the 1819 map). The open space around the gallows had been encroached upon by terraced housing, which extended across the line of the Bail defences. These roads became the framework around which the new terraced housing of the second half of the 19th century was constructed.Following enclosure, the roads east and west of the lower city (the roads leading out of Clasketgate and those leading into Newland except Carholme Road) were used only by local traffic heading for the newly created agricultural closes. However, like the roads leading into the upper city, these roads eventually became the skeleton of large 19th-century housing developments; Monks Road, West Parade and Newland Street West. They will contain not only evidence for the various schemes of paving which went with these new developments but also the remains of sewage and other utilities systems.",Summary,The RAZ includes the lines of the roads as depicted on the 1st edition O.S. map and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.8.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.8.1,

Because the channel of the river was shifted somewhat in 1804-16, it is possible that this bridge will survive substantially intact below ground level, the former course of the Drain presumably having been backfilled.

The building has been added to and altered subsequently, but it retains much original fabric, which must be carefully recorded during repairs. Several recent building recording projects have shown recently that even the tack-holes of the hangings can provide important evidence for the original layout of such buildings and from techniques such as these it should be possible to understand the way in which the elaborate social dance conducted in the Assembly Rooms was managed. Each different space will have been carefully fitted and decorated to indicate the relative social status of the occupants and future work should aim at elucidating this elaborate pattern of social spaces.

We have seen (RAZs 9.55.1, 9.55.2, 9.8.5) how the Monks of York were in constant dispute over the citizens' rights of grazing on the East Leas and, as the closes in Butwerk gradually fell out of use for occupation and were turned over to pasture, the need to define the edge of the common pasture and the boundary of the Monks' rights would inevitably result in calls for a barrier. The evidence for the existence of such a wall by the end of the 13th century, with a gate at the point where it was crossed by Baggerholme Road (i.e. Monks Road), has been provided by Dr Vince (chapter 9a). This boundary can be located, as in his reconstruction of the suburb Dr Vince has shown that the eastern boundary of the Blackfriars‰Û¡ÌÝå» precinct was also the eastern boundary of Butwerk. Consequently this boundary must have run along the approximate line of Arboretum Avenue and John Street, and the cutting of a section across its width, to ascertain its date and character, should become a priority. It is possible that the wall on this line was the same referred to in 1455 as Sneykedyke Wall (Cameron 1985, 187) and/or Cheviot Wall (Cameron 1985, 58). The gate at which tolls were paid on entering the city limits from the Monks' land to the east would, presumably, lie underneath Monks Road and is a rare category of medieval site. This gate was, presumably, administrative rather than defensive, a sort of customs post; no similar features have been explored in modern archaeology and any surviving remains should be carefully recorded. Both the wall and the gate at Butwerk need to be compared with apparently similar features defining the western boundary of the Newland suburb (RAZ 9.51.3).",Summary,The RAZ presumes a wall with a ditch 20m across outside of it.

77e38456-41a6-42bf-950e-b403a267615f,LARA RAZ AREA,,Gas production industry,"The first gas works in the city was built at the junction of Carholme Road and Brayford Wharf North, behind the public wharf, shortly after the foundation of the Lincoln Gas, Light and Coke Co. in 1828, presumably in order to take advantage of the waterways to import coal. 1828 is a relatively early date for the establishment of an urban gas supply (although compare Stamford, 1825, and Boston, Gainsborough and Louth, 1826). Although this does not put Lincoln in the forefront of the development of the gas industry nationally, nevertheless, the works site on Brayford Wharf North is an important survival, and probably in quite unaltered condition (Hockley 1992b). The gas produced here was initially used in street lighting, and the company was given a substantial boost in 1836 when extensive gas lighting was commissioned by the City Council. In 1885 the company finally passed into the Council‰Û¡ÌÝå»s ownership (ed. Birch 1906, 80, Nos. 760-2; Hill 1974, 226) and by 1887 the company had erected gasometers and other installations on the north side of Carholme Road, west of the original plant. This part of Brayford Wharf North was later known as Coal Wharf, presumably because of the quantities of coal imported by river to supply the retorts at the gas works. During the First World War a by-product recovery plant was installed to extract Toluol and Benzol for the high-explosive industries (Hockley 1992b, 6) and the remains of this plant will of great interest. A research agenda for this aspect of the Gas Industry is provided by Cocroft 2000. Production ceased at the Carholme Road site in 1932. As an early, and apparently little altered, gas-production site (with the additional interest of the Toluol and Benzol extraction plant) the Carholme Road plant represents a rare and important archaeological resource. A research agenda for early gas sites such as this is provided in the Step 1 Report (Trueman 1997).In 1876 a new gas works was begun between Newark Road and the GNR (Honington line), almost certainly designed to take advantage of deliveries of coal by rail, which were not possible on the Carholme Road site. This was a large plant, of considerable interest nationally as a representative of the great age of gas production (Trueman 1997), and will incorporate examples of the many technical improvements brought about within the industry during the central part of the 19th century. Major civic investment is recorded when the Council took over the Gas-Light and Coke Company in 1885, and an interesting study would be possible here of the impact of public investment in previously private industry. The interesting mechanisms by which the retorts were fed by coal from the railway via large hydraulic lifts (Herridge 1999, No.5225) need to be investigated through fabric study or through investigation during the course of repairs or development. The site was reconstructed in 1932-3, a move that brought the plant up to the latest standards, and the archaeological remains of this technological up-grade will also be of interest to historians of the gas industry.",Summary,Both RAZ elements are mapped following the sites‰Û¡ÌÝå» depiction on the 1887 O.S. map and including a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.44,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.44,

781a2c47-45d9-4866-ae30-a4a62700c850,LARA RAZ AREA,,The baths,"There are many anthropological parallels for the ritual significance of bathing, particularly in public, but although there is plenty of evidence to demonstrate the ceremonial and ritualistic aspects of bathing in the Roman period, they are much less frequently discussed. This was undoubtedly ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» space, therefore, and, as we have observed in several other RAZs, in the Roman world ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» and sacred rituals were largely indistinguishable. Although it is the hydraulic engineering of bath houses which is frequently stressed, there is great potential for understanding more of the symbolic meaning of the baths. Plan form and the use of space is an important aspect of this, but so too are matters such as water supply and disposal. If ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» bathing has a ritual character then the origin of the water, the way in which it is treated within the bath house and the way in which it is disposed of become matters of great interest. Consequently, it is not just the plan of the Lindum bath house itself towards which attention needs to be directed, but we should also investigate the passage of the water itself. In the Lincoln case, it seems that water supply on the hilltop must have been almost exclusively through wells. The large well in the east range of the Forum would have been one important water source, and because it came from the Forum (whose ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» and therefore ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásacred‰Û¡ÌÝå» nature has already been considered - RAZ 7.15) it might have been thought particularly suitable for bathing rituals. It may be doubted, however, whether this one well could have possibly supplied all of the water needed for a large baths complex, and many other wells must have existed within the upper city in the Colonia Era, including the reportedly very large well known as the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáBlind Well‰Û¡ÌÝå», which was very near the Bath House (in the garden of No.6 James Street). According to the account of this well in Britton‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Beauties in Gough‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Camden (1806, 366; Britton 1812, 600-1), pipes of the same type as those found in the aqueduct emerged here. Since it was first recorded as such in the 18th century, the known aqueduct running into the city alongside Nettleham Road has been said to have supplied the upper city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s needs, through storing the water in a castellum aquae, the remains of which still survive in East Bight. The very small capacity of the aqueduct, however, represents a serious problem in interpreting this as a utilitarian water supply, and it may be preferable to interpret this astonishing, highly engineered structure as a mechanism for carrying water that was highly prized. Prized more for its ritual potency, perhaps, than because it was available in large quantities (see RAZ 7.17).",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include the reconstructed plan of at least part of the bath complex based on excavations by Mr D.

Further work on the site can only be undertaken on the outlying parts of the burial ground but, nevertheless, such work does have an important role to play. One of the greatest limitations on the value of the evidence from the St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s excavations was the lack of context for the skeletal material recovered. Although a large number of interments were excavated, it is not known what percentage of the graveyard population they represent and consequently, even though the level of analysis undertaken on the excavated remains was minimal, even those results cannot be set in context until the whole population within the limits of the graveyard has been recovered. Further work is needed, therefore, on the surviving fragments of graveyard around the totally excavated church to try and set the population already excavated in some meaningful context. In addition to further burials it is expected that there will be a series of key archaeological relationships between the churchyard and the Mint Wall or buildings that incorporate it. These archaeological relationships are of very great importance to our understanding of the development of the church site in both the Early and High Medieval Eras and should be pursued as a matter of top priority (see also RAZ 8.1.1). We need to know whether the small 10th-century stone structure, which succeeded the apsidal building and was located over the hanging-bowl grave, was the only ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáchurch‰Û¡ÌÝå» in the graveyard, or whether it was merely a secondary monument in the graveyard serviced by other churches of higher status based either to the north (around the Mint Wall) or conceivably to the east (in the area of the 'monasterium' of All Saints). As in the Early Medieval Era, it is only through developing our understanding of the context in these and similar ways that we are going to make progress with our interpretations of this site in the High Medieval Era. One of the remarkable discoveries of the St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s excavations was that even a church which had such early and unusual origins could look like a normal urban parish church in both its archaeology and its documentary history from about the 11th century onwards. There should be a point in its sequence of development when its configuration as a proprietary church becomes manifest; a point one might expect to occur in the 10th or 11th centuries, and at any rate before the church is revealed as having been in private hands at the start of the 12th century (Jones et. al 1996, 101). In this respect the sequence of development at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s needs to be compared systematically with the known development of other parish churches in the city up until about 1350. In the St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s case the survival of documentary evidence for a collapse in, or shortly before, 1301, and the consequent requirement that the church was rebuilt (Hill 1948, 104; Owen 1971, 114), provide an important dated horizon within the artefact assemblage, and should prompt us to consider the buoyancy of the Bail economy at the point when the trading economy of the lower city was collapsing. It has been suggested elsewhere, however (RAZ 9.24), that the economy of the Bail may not have taken the spectacular plunge experienced by the lower city in the 14th century and this may suggest that we should explore the contrast which enabled an uphill parish to partly reconstruct its parish church at a time when parishes in the lower city may have been experiencing the start of a depopulation.Just as interesting, in any future study, will be any indications that the story of the church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s origins as the foundation left by St Paulinus following the baptism of Blaecca was expressed in its overall design or in the detail with which it was decorated. W",Summary,"The site of the churchyard is known, although it is anticipated that the early medieval churchyard will have been larger to north, south, east and west than that marked on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map. Consequently, the RAZ extends into the middle of the three roads that surround the site on the north east and west sides.On the south side the locations of the early boundaries of the churchyard are unknown. Before the introduction of Bailgate as a formal north-south street in the early 12th century, it is possible that the churchyard extended a considerable distance to the south and, therefore, a RAZ boundary has been selected which includes the ground below the properties north of Gordon Road. Further work needs to be undertaken to establish the original extent of the churchyard's southern boundary.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.29,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.29,

The building was planned from the early 1870s, building begun in 1876 and was already occupied by 1878. The layout was conceived of as a number of independent blocks connected with corridors, facing south, over the Witham. The south faÌÎå_ade was deliberately imposing and, in so far as it resembled a country house, it was a very public statement of the paternalistic aspirations of the health authority that was visible for miles. The layout of the original buildings is of considerable interest and future work should concentrate on its elucidation.

7993c87b-935e-4ca6-93df-b5c21390869d,LARA RAZ AREA,,Lower Wigford market,"Dr Vince has made a strong case, on plan-morphology grounds, that the whole of the lower part of the suburb of Wigford was laid out around a huge funnel-shaped market place (chapter 9a). Fortunately the superimposition of the Sincil Dyke, which must have occurred prior to the foundation of the Malandry (RAZ 9.56) at the start of the 12th century, gives us a date for its foundation in the 11th century. Confirmation of this date, however, is urgently required through future excavation work. The market is a similar same shape to that in Eastgate (RAZ 9.17) and, like that market and Newport (RAZ 9.16), it had a church standing centrally on the green. Whereas we can suggest that St John Newport and St Leonard were both founded at the same time as the markets, presumably to serve the traders who lived along the green‰Û¡ÌÝå»s edges and the visitors to the market, it is less clear that St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church was a new foundation (RAZ 9.60.21). It has several characteristics which set it apart from St John and St Leonard. It gave its name to a prebendal of the cathedral and this might indicate that it had been a relatively senior church in the hierarchy, on its donation. It certainly implies its existence prior to c.1100, when it was granted to the Cathedral by Henry 1st in 1100x1107 (ed. Greenway 1977, 54). Interestingly, the church of Holy Cross (RAZ 9.60.16), to the north but still in Lower Wigford, was in the same situation and must also have been founded by this date (Ibid., 93). We know nothing of the appearance of Holy Cross, but St Botolph's is known to have been a grand building architecturally (the only one of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churches which is know to have been laid out in a cruciform plan). These indicators do not preclude St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s having been founded specifically to serve the market, but they may indicate that process here is more complicated than may at first appear. It is the apparent seniority of St Botolph which makes one wonder if there had been a pre-existing settlement here, prior to the layout of the formal market place in the 11th century. Such a settlement could, anyway, have had its origins in a much earlier, informal market, not unlike the type of fair which might be implied by the place-name Baggerholme in Butwerk. Lower Wigford, then, should be thought of as a potential focus for early trading activity, presumably related to the hypothetical beach-market being held in Upper Wigford (RAZ 9.4). The fact that two of the three churches in Lower Wigford gave their names to prebends of the Cathedral may also suggest some interest by the church authorities in this part of the city at an early date. Were they responsible for laying out the market, we might wonder? Certainly St Botolph and Holy Cross stand at either end of it, like St Nicholas and St John in Newport, and St Peter and St Leonard in Eastgate. Such an explanation would mean that St Margaret‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church and parish (RAZ 9.60.24) is a relatively late interloper into the parochial pattern here, although it is one of those which was granted to the Precentor in 1147 (ed. Foster 1931, RA302, 262-3).The boundary between the market of Lower Wigford and suburb to the north was evidently of great importance. Was the Great Gowt a boundary demarcating jurisdictions? Should we be contemplating, for example, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáaliens‰Û¡ÌÝå» to the north of the boundary, engaged in a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáwholesale‰Û¡ÌÝå» trade and importing from ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáabroad‰Û¡ÌÝå» under closely supervised circumstances, whilst the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáretail‰Û¡ÌÝå» trade of the same goods took place only in the market place south of the Gowt? Such questions are fundamental to understanding of the early trading economy of early medieval Lincoln, yet Lower Wigford has yet to be investigated in any area excavation. The properties lining the High Street in Lower Wigford, however, were not merely the dwellings of market traders and we have an important documentary reference to a tannery in St Margaret‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Parish, Wigford around 1200 (ed.

7b1e91f1-8e6b-42dd-a1e4-1ab00d0644dd,LARA RAZ AREA,,The forum,"Most obvious amongst the colonia structures of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» and/or ritual character is the complex of large rooms, shrines and open spaces which made up the Forum. These buildings were undoubtedly ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» space, but we should not seek to define too closely which parts of it were used for ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáritual‰Û¡ÌÝå» purposes and which were used for ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásecular‰Û¡ÌÝå» ones. Although our society draws a clear distinction between secular and sacred administration it is clear that similar distinctions were not drawn in the Roman world. Justice of all types was undertaken in the name of the God/Emperor, in the ritualistic setting of the hall which was in a building complex focused on the God/Emperor‰Û¡ÌÝå»s shrine. There may be, consequently, little point in conceiving rigid distinctions between the Forum buildings and the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátemple of the Imperial cult‰Û¡ÌÝå». Certain of the more arcane functions of the cult may take place in specialised buildings, often called temples, but the whole Forum complex benefited from the God/Emperor‰Û¡ÌÝå»s benevolence and in that respect was a ritual complex. The relationship between the Forum and what had gone before it is revealing. The Forum complex took the place of the Principia of the legionary fortress (RAZ 6.9.2). It was a rebuilding, but it followed quite similar lines and it may be that the buildings of the Forum intended to evoke the military building. Any such intentional evocation would give us the vital clue as to the Forum‰Û¡ÌÝå»s symbolic meaning - it is the embodiment in stone of the martial prowess of the Empire lead by its military godhead the Emperor. This possible continuity between the Principia and Forum is critical to our understanding of the intentions underpinning the new colonia. Particular care needs to be taken to establish the sequence and timetable by means of which the military building gave way to its successor. Given what has been said before (RAZ 6.9.2) about the possibility of certain architectural details being related to specific Legions within the army, we need to ask whether a similar architectural meaning should be expected in the coloniae. A detailed comparison between the Forum plans of Lincoln and Gloucester and the Principia buildings of different legions should be attempted to see if any distinctive characteristics emerge. From this type of work it may be possible not just to say that the colonia was founded with the intention that it was housed an auxiliary reserve, but also specifically that it housed a military reserve attached to a specific legion. It is possible, Mr Jones believes, that some of the earlier post-military evidence from SP72 suggests the construction of an earlier forum of the first half of the 2nd century (chapter 7a). This forum may have had a markedly different layout from that which followed it and this might suggest a different series of preoccupations on the part of its builders. This intermediate forum needs further exploration and, particularly, we need to ask whether its plan shows that more emphasis was laid on its ritual sites than on other functions, such as its role as a market place. It is not just the Forum which may be intended to evoke the legionary background of settlement; by retaining the plan and by retaining the walls themselves, the whole of the upper city is a symbol directed towards the surrounding countryside of the military roots of imperial conquest and power. The population which built the Forum and retained the walls in this overtly military form were themselves, of course, retired members of that military machine and it is not surprising, therefore, that the colonia resembles nothing so much as a self-governing regimental museum. It is indications, then, that military practice was being followed, or not followed, within the construction and subsequent re-constructions of the Forum that will be of particular interest. To what extent did citizens of the 3rd and 4th centuries seek to retain ‰Û¡ÌÝÌámilitary‰Û¡ÌÝå» traditions in the reconstructi",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries are drawn to include the plan of the whole forum complex, including the so called ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátemple‰Û¡ÌÝå» to the south, as reconstructed by Mr Jones.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.15,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.15,

Hill (1948, 331) thought that the people of Wigford were ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáso wholly urban in origin they never felt the need for it‰Û¡ÌÝå». In the High Medieval Era, Hill‰Û¡ÌÝå»s short observation goes to the heart of our understanding of the nature of urbanism in Lincoln, but in the Early Modern Era we might view this strange distribution of arable rights as a mere hang-over from earlier times. The lack of arable in Wigford, however, may well have had an impact on the character of this area in decline. Presumably, in contrast to uphill suburbs like Newport, Wigford residents who supported themselves by farming are more likely to have been pastoralists. The archaeology of the fields themselves is likely to be rather coarse and uninformative on a small scale. The most informative studies will be those conducted on air photos taken before the redevelopment of the northern part of the fields for housing. Some of these show evidence for ridge and furrow and it may be possible, using early mapping and the Enclosure Award, to develop a picture of the field system in its final stages. Excavation may be a less effective technique of exploration here, but even so soil analyses from widely scattered sites in the fields may provide useful information about relative fertility and, over time, the distribution patterns of pottery may give some indication about manuring at different periods. It is likely that many boundary stones were placed in the Lincoln fields, as they were in all such systems, but it is equally likely that these would have been simple rough boulders and thus not easily spotted in the modern urban environment. The fields will have contained a variety of other structures, besides soil platforms. All open field systems contained ephemeral sheds for shelter and the storage of tools, as well as earthwork and timber structures to support stands for peas and beans etc. The known locations of a number of windmills in the fields of Lincoln are known (RAZs 10.42-44), but there are several others which are mentioned but unknown and whose locations may come to light during development work within this RAZ. These unallocated mills include the Chapter Mills (Cameron 1985, 186) and the Windmill outside Newport, the latter documented from as early as 1280 and apparently still in existence in 1605 (Cameron 1985, 189) - it was perhaps identical with the Mill Hill in the north field (Ibid. 184). It is debatable whether this description could apply to the West Mills along the cliff edge.",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the whole area of the original three-field system of Lincoln field. It therefore includes the land below what are presumed to be the later suburbs of Newport and Eastgate. Although East Field and North field were always primarily arable in rotation with pasture, this was true only of parts of Low field (to the west), which, although part of the three-field rotation, were nevertheless in permanent pasture. This RAZ, therefore includes the whole of RAZ 10.8.2 . Although Hill believed (1948, 331) that the Monks Leys estate (RAZ 10.8.5) was also considered to be part of the open fields of Lincoln, the various disputes with the city suggest that this is unlikely. This area seems to have been private land in the 15th and 16th centuries on which the citizens tried to maintain their common grazing rights. None of the disputes surrounding Monks Leys involved efforts by the citizens to plough the land, and therefore this block of land is not included within this RAZ.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.9.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.9.1,

7babd7ba-5e8b-4c34-90be-dfa318f91310,LARA RAZ AREA,,Roman Catholic churches,"At the start of the Industrial Era there was no purpose-built church for Roman Catholics - services were held in a garret at the top of a house in Bank Street (Hill 1966, 66; Bennett 1982, 15; RAZ 10.25). In 1799, however, a church was built by Henry Best near the corner of Silver Street and Broadgate (Stark 1810, 306. This church was rebuilt in 1854 (Hill 1974, 184) but proposals for a grand new church, drawn up in 1885 at the behest of F.J. Clarke, the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s most prominent Roman Catholic, came to nothing (Elvin 1981, 7). In 1887 the 1st edition O.S. showed no church on the Silver Street site, but instead, a temporary church (The ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáTin Bethel‰Û¡ÌÝå» - Bennett 1982, 24) on the corner of Park Street and the new southward extension of Beaumont Fee. This building was also presented by F.J. Clarke and buried remains of it will be of considerable interest. We should be able to understand which aspects of the Roman Catholic liturgy were reproduced in these temporary circumstances, and how. This building might be compared, particularly, with its Anglican equivalent - the 'Tin Tabernacle' of St Matthew Boultham Park Road (RAZ 11.92.10). It will be interesting to see how the two faith communities coped with similar structural and doctrinal challenges in the context of a temporary and pre-fabricated architecture. In 1893 the present St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Church was built on the south side of Monks Road (to designs by Albert Vicars). The buried remains of the 1799 church on the south-west corner of Silver Street and Broadgate will be an interesting example of a chapel built before Catholic Emancipation. The 1854 building may reflect the new confidence brought about by Emancipation and it will be interesting to see how discrete the two buildings are in their architectural designs. By the 1880s there was also a presbytery and other buildings attached to the chapel, and a comparison between these buildings and their contemporary Anglican and Dissenter equivalents would be most interesting. The existing church in Monks Road is a fine example of an important provincial Catholic church of the turn of the century and preserved in its fabric and fittings will be evidence for the liturgical layout of the first church. Repairs and alterations here should be accompanied by a recording programme. A useful research agenda for the topic may be found in CBA 1985 and Gilchrist & Morris 1996.The 1887 church in Park Lane is planned using the boundaries of the plot marked on the 1st edition O.S. map. The Silver Street chapel site has been drawn following the plot marked on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1848 whilst the plot of St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Monks Road is derived from the 2nd edition O.S. map.",Summary,The boundaries of the known chapels are known from Padley's 1842 map and from various versions of the OS. It has not been possible to locate the building in Bank Street where services were held in the 18th century.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.98,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.98,

7c8a267f-43ea-4fb8-8cb6-c929090cf1ed,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Radial Roads South Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe majority of South Lincoln Ribbon Development Character Area is composed of residential development built for the middle classes during the Inter-War Period. Nonetheless, housing in the area illustrates nearly a full spectrum of the construction of housing along some of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s major roads from the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period to the modern day.The backbone of the Character Area is formed by the four main roads which emanate from the village of Bracebridge in the south of Lincoln. The roads, which converge on the historic bridging point of the River Witham, have connected Lincoln with its hinterland since the Roman Military Era.Earlier housing is dispersed throughout the Character Area, appearing both in groups or as individual houses. Subsequent Inter-War development appears to spread from the city centre, leading to long continuous lengths of housing from the same period. Modern development is more sporadic, often relating to areas of infill or re-development of gap sites and land formerly within larger gardens of earlier housing.Much of the townscape has a coherent character. The majority of properties are two storeys in height and two bays in width, and are consistently set back in straight or stepped building lines arranged parallel to the street. Houses face the road, creating a feeling of security and activity along streets, and are set towards the front of spacious rectangular plots aligned perpendicularly to the road. The common direction of plots and their relatively consistent dimensions create a regular grain throughout the area. There is a medium-to-high density of buildings, resulting in mostly continuous building lines and a consistent sense of enclosure along streets, which is often heightened by mature trees along roads and tall borders along plot boundaries. Public/private boundaries to the front are often demarked by privet hedging, and roads have grass verges and/or trees, generating a coherent feeling between streets in the area. The majority of Inter-War properties have driveways and/or garages illustrating the increased use of the private motorcar during the early-mid 20th century.Properties are built of brick and other small-scale materials, and are often very similar in form and construction. Houses are rectangular in plan and often have a projecting wing or bay window to the front faÌÎå_ade. Properties are mostly differentiated through the incorporation of various decorations, which in many cases illustrates the ability of prospective owners to choose decorative elements of their buildings when ‰Û¡ÌÝÌábuying off plan‰Û¡ÌÝå». Open space in the area is limited, and is mainly composed of private sports complexes in the northwest of the area, alongside private gardens to the rear of houses.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 27,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,104,

As the cross was already broken by 1324 we might presume that it was already of some antiquity by that date. If this is correct then this could have been a much earlier marker, perhaps marking a meeting place from the pre-Conquest period, like the Lincolnshire example at Elloe Stone, Moulton, which marked a wapentake meeting place (Everson and Stocker 1999, 162-4).",Summary,"The precise location of the cross is not known, although we may speculate that it was located at the junction between Cliffgate and Bradegate.

The church was sensitively restored in 1874-5 and in 1895, on both occasions in an antiquarian spirit (Stocker and Everson 1990); even the details of the restorations themselves are of interest to students of the growth of antiquarianism. It will be interesting to assess the influence on the church in the late 19th century of F.J. Clarke, who built the adjacent hall (RAZ 11.19.2). He was a Roman Catholic, but was also very keen to play the role of lord of the manor at Bracebridge, which must have involved him in church affairs. He designed his own family vault for the church (Elvin 1974, 8) and this will be an interesting example of a Roman Catholic mausoleum in an Anglican church. Similarly the graveyard population will also provide an indicator of the success of the settlement. There were probably few burials made here in the period prior to c.1880, but following that date the cemetery has been well-used and modern burials may have disturbed more ancient ones, in spite of a cemetery extension to the south. The composition of this graveyard population is of great interest for earlier periods, but it may be difficult to distinguish burials of the Industrial Era.",Summary,The RAZ is defined by the graveyard mapped on the 1st edition O.S.

Like Sts Bavon and Rumbold there is no reference to the liquidation of the assets of the church by the City Council in the Reformation period, and we are probably justified in presuming that it had been demolished and disposed of before that date. As in these cases, archaeology should aim to explain something of the mechanisms of this disposal and refine the date at which it occurred.",Summary,"Following detailed documentary research by Mr Johnson and Dr Vince we are now able to propose a likely site for the church. It probably occupied a plot of land in the extreme eastern end of the suburb that belonged to the rectory of St Peter at Arches, the city church, from at least 1577. Dr Vince has proposed that the site of the church is to be located through Willson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s references to a group of burials located east of Sparrow Lane.

Shortly afterwards they moved into the building vacated by the County Hospital when it moved out of its buildings along Wordsworth Street in the centre of town to its site on Greetwell Road (RAZ 11.52.1 & 11.52.2). The adaptations made to the hospital grounds and buildings are of some interest, because they provide an unusual contrast between the stringencies advocated by a mid-Victorian charitable institution and one where the stringencies were imposed by the occupants themselves. These alterations may reflect the collegiate and ascetic ideal espoused during the Anglican revival of the second half of the 19th century. The chapel of 1907 (by Temple Moore) is an important building in its own right and the fabric should be recorded in detail during repairs and alterations. In particular we should be interested in the differences in decorative treatment thought appropriate in this college context when compared with similar decorative schemes in local parish churches (such as at St Peter Eastgate - where the same architect was employed in 1914).",Summary,The many RAZ components are mapped following the boundaries depicted on various O.S. map editions and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.63,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.63,

7e58ef15-0820-4667-be31-47f8e3e3b6c7,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Burton Road Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌBurton Road Character Area is composed of Late Victorian/Edwardian terraced houses interspersed with later Post-War and Modern infill and redevelopment. The area is mainly residential is use, with a dispersed number of civic and commercial properties. Burton Road forms the backbone of the area, and buildings along its length illustrate the development of Lincoln from the 18th to the 21st century. The layout of southern parts of the townscape is strongly influenced by the former Roman and Medieval walled cities. Much of the townscape is divided into small urban blocks defined by two poorly interconnected grid-iron patterns of streets of terraced houses. Main roads carry large volumes of vehicular traffic, and properties add to a feeling of activity, with doors and windows facing the street. A high density of buildings throughout the area creates a strong and regular sense of enclosure along narrow streets which decreases along wider roads. Properties are regular in form and scale and consist of rows of terraced houses, with dispersed groups of individual detached and semi-detached buildings.Properties along connecting roads and a dispersed number of detached buildings are often earlier in date and show a greater diversity in use, form, style, and construction. The buildings are often larger in scale than surrounding terraced houses, occasionally more decorative in style, and frequently incorporate stone features. Several buildings, mostly along main roads and/or street corners, have gabled features at eaves level, emphasising their prominent status and/or location.Rows of terraced houses are plain in style and are coherent in character. However, rows made up of one or a number of build units are differentiated through small changes in scale, decoration, and the position of houses on their plots. Differences between build units illustrate the development of the Late Victorian/Edwardian suburb. There are few civic buildings in the area, as many sites have been redeveloped during the Post-War and Modern Periods. The buildings are generally larger in scale and occupy large rectangular plots, with their widest sides parallel to the road. A variety of infill development dating to Inter-War, Post-War and Modern Periods is dispersed throughout the area. Inter-War and Post-War developments are plain in style and mainly consist of semi-detached houses, bungalows, and short rows of four houses. The form and style of Modern housing varies, although within individual build units, buildings are coherent in character. Houses vary in scale, from small groups of bungalows of three-bay widths, to large two- to three-storey apartment blocks of three to four bays in width. Houses are less regular in layout than surrounding terraced rows, and often have indistinct public/private boundaries.Many original features and materials throughout the townscape have been substituted with modern replacements There is limited open space with the Character Area, and the majority is composed of private gardens as opposed to any public accessible areas.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 66,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,16,

7e793c38-d668-402c-b321-707bfbbc9cf5,LARA RAZ AREA,,Water supply industry,"At the start of the Industrial Era the public water supply to the city was still that which had been reconstructed by the City Council in the 1540s out of the monastic supply (Stocker 1990). This was essentially a single conduit that brought water to a series of tanks and faucets along High Street. An obelisk was built to house the faucet on High Bridge in 1762/3 (RAZ 11.6.5), but the faucet and tank at St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Conduit remained in its unaltered, 16th-century, state. In 1864 the conduit was extended southwards to cater for the growing Wigford population and the fountain outside St Peter at Gowt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church remains (Herridge 1999, No.5356). A second new faucet fed by this conduit system was built in 1869 at the junction of Baggeholme Road and Croft Street inn 1869. This supply can never have satisfied the whole requirements of the city and it must have been supplemented by many private wells. Uphill, wells remained the only source of water. A Lincoln Waterworks Company was formed in 1846 with the intention of providing a modern supply and by 1848 the Prial Brook had been dammed along the line of Skellingthorpe Road to create a large reservoir to the south. The reservoir later became the principal landscape feature in the extensive grounds of Hartsholme Hall, built in 1862 (RAZ 11.34). The brick-fronted dam is a relatively early surviving example of this type of structure and requires detailed archaeological survey aimed at establishing how much of the associated machinery controlling the sluices and other equipment survives. The archaeological structure of the dam is buried beneath the road and opportunities should be taken during the repair and maintenance of services to explore it. From here the water was carried by a culvert north to the Catchwater Drain (RAZ 11.4.2) and thence to the filter beds at Boultham, where there were originally two sand filter-beds. By the time of the 1st edition O.S. map there were four. From here the water was carried in a nine-inch cast-iron water main to an open reservoir in Westgate, north of the later Water Tower. To provide the necessary pressure a 33hp beam engine from a Cornish tin mine was provided inside a purpose-built pump house to the west of the reservoirs at Boultham Park and although the engine was replaced, the engine house survived until recent times. The engine mountings for the various beam engines will be of considerable technical interest and should be recorded during future works on the site. In 1871 the City Council purchased the water supply company and a second holding reservoir was built above Bracebridge (now outside the city boundary). The filter bed systems themselves will be of considerable technical interest and should be the subject of archaeological recording during future works on the site especially as they presumably represent a sequence of advances in filtration technology. After 1871 the city also began to extract water directly from the Witham, however, and soon installed another pumping engine to feed the filter beds, the archaeological remains of which will made interesting technical comparisons with the first. In 1905, however, Lincoln suffered a typhoid epidemic which was blamed on the inadequacies of the water supply and for a period the city was supplied by water brought in from the surrounding area. This was the stimulus for a wholesale reconstruction of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s water supply; the open reservoir in Westgate was replaced by the noble stone water storage tower (designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield - Herridge 1999, 5018), begun in 1907 and not completed until 1911, and a second closed reservoir was provided at the site on Bracebridge Heath. These new reservoirs would be fed from an entirely new source from boreholes at Elkesley in Nottinghamshire via a 22 mile-long cast iron main of 21 inches diameter. Once the new supply was in place the old works at Boultham were closed, to be converted into Boultham Baths (RAZ 11.79). The tower itself is a maj",Summary,The various RAZ elements are mapped following the depictions on various O.S. map editions and including a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.46,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.46,

Dr Vince explains in chapter 9a that it is likely that the barrier across the river (originally of much earlier date - RAZ 5.2, 6.4, 7.17, 8.3.2) was reconstructed and brought back into use as a water-control mechanism in the 10th century. This hypothesis has been put forward on the basis of the changing nature of the quaysides and the pattern of pottery imports into the city, but it requires corroboration through an investigation of the Stamp End causeway itself. We should look, therefore, for evidence of the dates at which the structure was repaired and re-edified and compare these closely with what is already known about the dates at which the quaysides upstream were constructed and areas of pool were reclaimed.We also need to understand what provision was made for boats to pass around the terminal ends of the causeway. On the way upstream it is likely that there will have been facilities to enable boats to be carried round the structure in a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáportage‰Û¡ÌÝå», and evidence for this might survive in the form of slipways by means of which boats would be hauled out of the water. It is also possible that laden boats will have passed downstream through ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáflash locks‰Û¡ÌÝå». The massive structures needed for such features are likely to survive within the fabric of the dam. One might have expected the dam to have also been used as a convenient location for mills, utilising the head of water behind. There is no documentary evidence for such features, but their presence might be searched for.",Summary,"The precise location of the medieval Stamp End causeway is not known (it is not documented until 1455 - RAZ 10.1), but it is likely to have been within 100m of the modern lock, probably to its east rather than to its west.

80be6c73-e697-4eec-a280-0ff4f781a853,LARA RAZ AREA,,Hill top activity,"Having left the causeway, on the northern side of the gap, the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáJurassic Way‰Û¡ÌÝå» will have climbed diagonally across the cliff face reaching the crest somewhere in the vicinity of Christ‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hospital Terrace, and we have to consider the possibility that it was heading for some form of occupation on the hill top. No firm archaeological evidence has yet come to light for any pre-Roman activity or enclosure on the hill top, but Jones and Stocker point out (chapter 5a) that, in the topographically similar ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágap‰Û¡ÌÝå» locations at Ancaster and Kirmington, the river crossing is overlooked by an important enclosure. Although neither of these two parallel sites has been excavated, Honington Camp at Ancaster has produced finds of the Pre-Roman Iron Age, whereas the small number of finds so far sourced to Yarborough Camp Kirmington have been predominantly Roman. However, both sites evidently became specialised Romano-British ritual enclosures, perhaps surrounding Romano-Celtic temples and although there is no firm evidence for pre-Roman origins at Yarborough Camp, such origins must be suspected. From excavations at Lincoln, in the equivalent location, the only hints of anything earlier than the Neronian fortress are what may have been ditches and pits on the Lawn site (L86), which may be associated with a handful of conquest-period pot sherds. Although these features might be more safely interpreted as early military activity, we should bear in mind the possibility that they represent Iron Age activity in this exceptional location. The only known feature on the hill top which might deserve consideration (or reconsideration) as being of potentially pre-Roman date is the well shaft, in what was to become, first, the principia of the Roman fortress and then the forum of the colonia. None of the archaeological material associated with the well during excavation can be dated earlier than the 2nd century, but, equally, there was no conclusive evidence to show that the shaft could not have been re-used from earlier phases. Such earlier phases could have belonged to the Late Pre-Roman Iron Age as easily as they could have belonged to the Roman military occupation. Although the excavation of the well fills provided little information about the Roman period (SP84), no evidence at all was recovered for the date of its original construction, and it could as easily be Iron Age as Roman. The possibility that the well-shaft was in existence when the Roman fortress was constructed might be suggested by the fact that it is not symmetrically set within the new principia building. The well is a very large feature and consequently had it been built by the Roman army we might have expected it to have been given a focal, or at least a symmetrical, location in the new headquarters building. As it is, in Mr Jones‰Û¡ÌÝå» reconstruction, the well is placed close to the angle of the north and east walks of the veranda enclosing the courtyard. This awkward siting could imply either that the well was not dug until the Colonia Era, or that it was a pre-Roman Iron Age feature which was retained in the new military layout. Such wells and shafts are, of course, a feature of the European pre-Roman Iron Age. Some pre-Roman Iron Age sacred ditched and banked enclosures, looking superficially very similar to Honington and Yarborough Camps, surround totems of various types (for example that at Glorying in the Rhineland - Chadwick 1971, 163-4). Nora Chadwick compares such enclosures with henge monuments, suggesting that they are not occupation sites, but primarily gathering places for the local community dedicated to community ceremonials (1971, 166-7). A large number of Romano-Celtic enclosures enclose specific foci, shafts, wells springs and burials (Ross 1968; Ross and Feachem 1976). The famous ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáMseke Zehovice head‰Û¡ÌÝå», for example, was buried in a pit at the centre of a rectangular earthwork enclosure about 200m x 150m and many so-called Viereckshanzen take this form (Green 1976",Summary,"As this RAZ is almost entirely notional, it is hard to suggest boundaries. The most promising site for any enclosure which overlooked the Trent Valley to the west and the causeway and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásacred pools‰Û¡ÌÝå» to the south would be in the area of the present castle. We might think that it was important, as it seems to be at both Kirmington and Honington, that views from the enclosure are maximised and, also, that the enclosure itself can be seen from key locations, including the valley floor sites with which they are associated. As it happens, it is in the general vicinity of the Castle that the earliest Roman pottery has been discovered. If we are to think of Yarborough and Honington camps as parallels, however, we should note that they are much smaller than the later Roman fortress (less than 4,000 m2). Even so the RAZ boundary must be considerably larger than this as we don‰Û¡ÌÝå»t know where exactly any such enclosure might be centred. A RAZ boundary line has been selected which follows the south wall of the fortress, extended to the west to take in the Lawn Hospital site up to, and including, the cliff edge itself, where, presumably the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáJurassic Way‰Û¡ÌÝå» will pass outside any ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáreserved‰Û¡ÌÝå» enclosure. The northern RAZ boundary is an arbitrary line drawn east-west at the latitude of the Water Tower, crossing Bailgate.

The result of such intervention over an extended period of time of more than a decade between the wars was the St Giles estate north-east of the city. The earliest houses to be developed were along Wragby Road by the Ministry of Munitions, but the Council began building on the land behind soon after the First World War (ibid.). The philosophy adopted for the planning of the new buildings was borrowed from the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágarden suburb movement‰Û¡ÌÝå» and in this respect the houses at St Giles should be compared to those at Swanpool to understand how the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágarden suburb‰Û¡ÌÝå» principles were assimilated into Local Authority housing. The most noticeable difference is that, as time went on and the Council developed more of the estate, northwards towards Nettleham Road, the sizes of the house-plots became smaller and the houses themselves less ambitious, less varied in design and less interesting. Even so as each section of the estate was developed the principles of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágarden suburb‰Û¡ÌÝå» movement continued to inform the layout of the streets, with long narrow curving avenues planted with English trees. In 1936 a new church was provided at the centre of the estate - a copy of the early 18th-century church of St Peter-at-Arches reusing many of its stone architectural details (RAZ 11.91.14 & 11.92.4). Opposite the church, and placed even more clearly at the centre of the community, is the site of St Giles‰Û¡ÌÝå» School (RAZ 11.61). The siting of the church and school at the focus of the new community expresses the aspirations of the city in founding the new community.Towards its north-western perimeter, houses along Outer Circle Road were constructed using ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápre-fab‰Û¡ÌÝå» techniques. These are of the same type as those in Grainsby Close (RAZ 11.32) but a second type of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápre-fab‰Û¡ÌÝå» based on a technique using steel sheets were experimented with in Addison Avenue. Although these buildings have now been re-clad, they remain important sources of information for these unusual construction technique (Newton and Boyson 2001, 16-17).",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the rear boundaries of the properties along Browning Drive, Wragby Road, the rear of the properties along Goldsmith Walk and, on the south-west, by the school and the properties along Macaulay Drive, Byron Avenue and Carlyle Walk.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.3,

The gardens, along with grass verges and a landscaped green area give a green appearance to the character area although there is a good sense of enclosure resulting from the houses being mostly set on the same building line with small gaps between them. The character area represents the 1950s and 1960s continuation of the suburbanisation process that had led to the creation of the adjacent Swanpool Garden Suburb. Housing is very similar in terms of architectural style despite comprising various build units, there is little detailing on facades and houses are of almost identical scale although those adjacent to Swanpool Garden Suburb have more detailing on the facades. Further unity is derived from the exclusive use of brick as a building material although the colours used do vary. The character area is relatively isolated from the rest of the city by its strong boundaries and road access being limited to that via Skellingthorpe Road.""",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 40,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,81,

Like St John (RAZ 9.60.1), its architectural development and the contents of its graveyard will be helpful in establishing a general pattern of prosperity in the suburb. The present boundary wall is of importance in its own right. It is made of reused medieval masonry and repairs to it should be accompanied by an appropriate level of archaeological recording.",Summary,"The site of the church is known precisely. The plot continued to be marked throughout the post-medieval period, but a length of the south side was thrown into Church Lane when that was widened in 1826 (Hill 1966, 211)(RAZ 10.60.2).

The surviving tower mill which survives on this site today was not built until 1798, but many topographical views from at least the early 17th century (Speed 1611) show post mills in a line along the top of the cliff, and a post mill (called Hobbler‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hole Mill) survived into the era of photography. The archaeological remains of the mills themselves will be of interest, of course, but less frequently investigated are the structures which accompanied them - granaries, storehouses and other structures. It would also be helpful to understand whether the millers, who were in a distinctive position in the social hierarchy, lived on the site, and if they did, their level of material comfort will be of interest in comparison with that of other classes of citizens found within the city. Over the long-term we should be interested in the total number of mills serving the city at any one time. If the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s population fell off as dramatically as we think likely in the 14th century, we might expect the number of mills to decline from that point. Speed shows seven in 1611 and, given the known de-population of the city by that date we should expect the 14th-century figure to have been much higher.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn as a north-south strip of properties 50m wide extending from 200m north of the cleft in the cliff marked by the modern Yarborough Road southwards to the projected line of Cliffgate.

The main features were the cutting of a new channel from the Prial Brook into the Witham (RAZ 11.4.1) and the cutting of a new drainage dyke to link with the western end of Great Gowts drain via a culvert under the Witham. This culvert is of considerable rarity and engineering interest and any remains of it should be recorded during development. The original techniques used for constructing the banks of the dykes will be of some interest, especially if they employed hard bracing, and along their lengths the remains of weirs, locks, valves or other features would be of considerable technical interest.",Summary,he RAZ follows the line of the new dyke including a 10m extension on either side to include the structural remains of the bank.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.4.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.4.2,

83dc5791-f286-4d12-afb4-9a23c76dd70c,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Michael-on-the-Mount,"Although the church survived in the 1549 re-organisation of parishes, and it was not one of those which had fewer than 10 inhabitants in 1428, we have little documentary information suggesting that the church was prosperous in the later medieval period and ruinous plots are reported in the parish as early as 1376 (Hill 1948, 288). The foundation of the guild of Corpus Christi in the church in 1350 (Westlake 1919 166-75; Hill 1948, 298) is important and the archaeology of the site should be able to cast some light on the guild‰Û¡ÌÝå»s liturgical space. The church seems to have been the chosen church for the foundation of a very late chantry - that of Robert Dyghton in 1521 (HMC 1895, 24, 29) - and the documentation surrounding this makes it clear that Dyghton was a substantial patron to his local church. Even though only founded shortly before the Reformation, it is likely that the chantry will be detectable archaeologically and it will be an important late example. The church will retain evidence for liturgical changes during the Reformation and, given its proximity to the Close it may also have suffered from the puritan iconoclasts in 1644 and subsequently. Certainly the church was in ruins by 1724 (Buck‰Û¡ÌÝå»s sketchbook - Bodleian/Gough Lincs. Ms. 15, f.94), but was rebuilt in 1739, partly through the exertions of the important early Lincoln antiquary Thomas Sympson (Hill 1966, 65). This church was built on a new site in the northern part of the modern graveyard and so it is likely to survive relatively well. It is a building of considerable interest, not only because early 18th-century churches are somewhat unusual in Lincoln, but also because Thomas Sympson may have imposed some of his reputedly ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáHigh Church‰Û¡ÌÝå» views on its design and fittings.",Summary,The RAZ includes the whole of the modern graveyard which is thought to be the same as that of its medieval predecessor.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.33,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.33,

8469c740-cce7-4c42-8540-fa82006e3432,LARA RAZ AREA,,Eastgate market,"The distinctive shape of the large open triangular space between Greetwell Road and Langworthgate suggests that it very likely owes its existence to a market held here. A public well, the Leadenwell, stood near the apex of the triangular plot of land and a maypole had been erected here before being depicted on Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1722. The provision of the market well is paralleled by the Grantham Well placed in the centre of the Newport market (RAZ 9.16) and perhaps also by the well in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s High Market (RAZ 9.22). The eastern side of the triangular market space may have originally been marked by the lane now called St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane, and the triangular block of properties to the west of it, therefore, will represent relatively late infill. Unlike Newport (but like several of the other newly-identified markets in Lincoln) there seems to be no documentation recording any market here, and this may mean that the triangular space was kept clear through informal gatherings at the road junction rather than a through a more formal process of foundation by charter. Further work in the area should seek to elaborate on this point. If the market space was informal, possibly unregulated, material from here should provide an important contrast with better known, more formally regulated markets in the city.The market around the which the suburb of Eastgate formed has some similarities with that in Newport, however. It was a different shape, being essentially triangular, between Langworthgate and Greetwell Road, but, like Newport, it had a church, or chapel, St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, at the end further from the city. Also like Newport, at the city end, was an apparently older church, St Peter in Eastgate. Although St Peter was certainly alongside the market place and not in its centre, it is not known precisely where St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church was positioned. It was clearly on the west side of St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane (ed. Major 1973, RA2715-21, p.45-50) and is said to have been on the site of the modern primary school (Venables 1886-7). If the eastern boundary of the market place is marked by St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane itself, as seems plausible, like St John in Newport and St Botolph in Wigford, St Leonard may have been ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáon the Green‰Û¡ÌÝå». Dr Vince makes a case (chapter 9a) that the Eastgate suburb might have started out as a planned grid of streets (RAZ 9.28), and it is clear that the funnel-shaped market is superimposed on any such grid. The possibility that the suburb developed in these two stages requires urgent investigation, and the date at which any fundamental change in plan occurred needs to be established.

The area, now amalgamated within the City of Lincoln, was once the location of an outlying village within the parish of Bracebridge.A few elements of the outlying village Bracebridge survive, including the 11th century All Saints Church, the Late Victorian/Edwardian Brantley Manor and Grosvenor Hall, and elements of parkland associated with the latter. However, much of the original village and its surrounds have been overwritten by series of residential developments constructed as Lincoln expanded south during the mid to latter part of the 20th century.The area is made up of a small number of public housing developments constructed during the Inter-War Period, alongside some smaller infill development dating to the Post-War and Modern Periods. Each residential housing development has an identifiable and consistent architectural style.The Character Area is composed of medium to large irregularly shaped urban blocks, the size and shape of which result from a lack of connectivity between developments and roads, as well as strong linear features along the eastern and western edges of the area. The majority of housing is built along cul-de-sacs.Much of the housing in the area dates to the Inter-War Period and consists of either terraced housing, or a mixture of short rows of four houses and semi-detached houses. Inter-War buildings are mostly one to two storeys in height and three bays in width. Based on the scale and form of Inter-War buildings, there are eight different building types in the area. Despite variations in housing type, properties within the Character Area have many common elements, and often demonstrate elements of the 1930‰Û¡ÌÝå»s ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáneo-vernacular‰Û¡ÌÝå» style.

The quarry is still worked and contains a number of important quarry installations intact (such as a tripod crane) which have been located here over its lifetime and not removed. An archaeological inventory of these machines should be drawn up at the earliest opportunity. The quarry floor will retain archaeological evidence for further structures, now dismantled, and for earlier patterns of working in the quarry. In 1889 there was a bank of limekilns here also (1st edition OS.), which shows that the Dean and Chapter were making their own lime. The remains of these kilns are of considerable importance as they will allow a full study of the way in which they were integrated within the quarry‰Û¡ÌÝå»s operation (see LUAU 1996b). It should be possible to identify which quarry beds were worked to feed the kilns and these can be contrasted with the beds used to provide free-stone for the various campaigns of repair and conservation at the Cathedral (documented in full in Gibbs 2001). Because we can estimate with some accuracy where the stone from this quarry was used, it represents a unique archaeological resource, allowing us to trace the entire process from winning the stone through working and dressing to its use in the building. Conversely the quarry has considerable importance for the conservation of the Cathedral, not just for the supply of new stone, but in providing archaeological evidence for the petrology and mason-craft of earlier campaigns of repair. A research agenda for stone quarries of this type has been issued (LUAU 1996a).",Summary,The RAZ boundary is drawn around the upper edge of the quarry face and includes the entry/exit from Ermine Street.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.41.5.,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.41.5.,

Butter was not the first commodity removed to this new location, in the centre of the shrunken town, as the Poultry market had been moved to the High Street in St Lawrence‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish as early as 1522. This may suggest that, in the 16th century, the Council aimed to centralise markets in this part of High Street north of Stonebow. Although the butter sellers may have had a partially enclosed space in Newland market, it seems likely that there was no shelter in their new location. This situation was remedied when a fine new two-storied structure was erected north of St Peter-at- Arches in 1736, and by then the butter sellers had been joined by those selling cheese, poultry, and eggs (HMC 1895, 117; ed.

The present layout of the council chamber dates from the start of the Industrial Era and has the arms of George II behind the dais. It was refitted in 1732 (Sympson 1737, 303) and is a fine example of a city chamber of this date, expressing as it does, the rising confidence of the city in the period of the re-opening of the Fossdyke. Clearly it is vital that detailed archaeological records are made in conjunction with any repairs or restorations here. For a long period prior to the Industrial Era, the council chamber had also served as a court-room for the city, and its re-equipment in the reign of George II explicitly recognises that. Consequently we should also be interested in the ways in which the building has been adapted to fulfil the needs of justice in the Industrial Era. Specifically, we need to understand how it inter-related with the city prison in the building immediately to the east.

8818370b-bab0-4471-8b6c-c176fe6f1b05,LARA RAZ AREA,,City docks 1) wharves along Waterside North east of the wall and the Blackdyke,"Although boats could probably pass through the barrier presented by the putative Stamp End causeway (RAZ 10.1), it is clear that most of the loading and unloading of boats to and from Boston took place at a dock below the dam on the edge of the property belonging to St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey York. The exact nature of this facility is very little known and a consolidated piece of documentary research is required, as a matter of priority, to map the various surviving documents against the modern base map. The dock (called the Blackdyke in the 15th century) is likely to have been an inlet, pool, or perhaps even an artificial parallel stream (given that it is called a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádyke‰Û¡ÌÝå») along the north bank of the Witham. The archaeology of the dock itself is likely to be valuable mostly on account of the debris with which it is filled, which will be at least partly water-logged. Within this assemblage it should be possible to chart the collapse in international trade in the 13th century and to make judgements as to where early modern traders were arriving from. The construction and reconstruction of the wharves themselves are likely to be of use in documenting the fall of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s industrial production. The development of the wool trade in the 14th century should also be visible in these structures, as should the gradual disappearance of the trade in the post-medieval period. It is notable that, in the 1428 assessment of parishes, the parish of St Augustine, which we know included the river frontage between Blackdyke and the City wall (ie, 10/1) was the only the parish in Butwerk which retained more than 10 inhabitants. It seems, then, that although the waterfront remained activity into the late medieval period and beyond, the remainder of the suburb had become deserted. It was probably the City Council‰Û¡ÌÝå»s interest in maintaining the Blackdyke and its associated facilities which encouraged them to make such a determined effort to obtain control of the Black Monks' property at the Dissolution (Hill 1956, 42). They were unsuccessful, however, and the Black Monks passed not into corporate, but into private hands. What effect, if any, did that have on the operation of the Blackdyke? The Council and citizens had long held rights of access, of course, and although their extended disputes with the Sapcote and Smith families were mostly about rights of pasture in the former Monks' estate, and it may be that the warehousing and docking facilities continued in use, though at a reduced level. The Blackdyke dock operated, of course, almost under the windows of the mansion house in the ruins of the former monastery (RAZ 9.53.5) and it is possible that the new house created here after the Dissolution, and occupied by major magnates such as the Smith and Grantham families, eventually had some impact on the dock. Certainly the City Council continued to own the freehold of warehouses along the quayside in this part of town and one was leased out as late as 1724 (ed. Birch 1906, 34, No.196). Furthermore the City Council continued to claim rights over land along the riverside south of the Monks' Abbey. After the wholesale changes in topography in this part of town following the construction of the Stamp End Lock in 1826 (RAZ 11.1), in 1830 the Council were leasing land here which was ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáformerly the osier land - now lost‰Û¡ÌÝå» (ed. Birch 1906, 73, No.987).",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the modern bank of the Witham on the south side, which is likely to represent the line of the latest medieval waterfront. The road which is referred to in several documents, and which entered the city to the south of the tower in Green Dragon Yard, ran along the quayside and behind the road lay the warehouses, known to have been used for storing wool after the middle of the 13th century. The western boundary of the RAZ is taken to be the city wall, but without an understanding of the location of the Blackdyke the eastern boundary of this RAZ is hard to estimate. An arbitrary line has been chosen due south of the church of the Benedictine Priory, but further documentary research may reveal that it extended further east than this.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.2,

881f120a-aad2-44da-a21a-cd1dacf93651,LARA RAZ AREA,,Chartist Colony in Brant Road,"Between 1845 and 1851 a small estate to the east of Brant Road, in Bracebridge parish was chosen as one of the five purchases by the trustees of the Chartist Land Plan (DCMS Blueback). The Chartist Land Plan was an important aspect of the powerful working-class movement that was Chartism, lead by the inspirational politician Feargus O‰Û¡ÌÝå»Connor, who turned increasingly to efforts at land reform after the presentation of the Great Charter to parliament in 1848. Essentially members of the working classes bought shares (on instalments and at cheap rates) in a National Land Company, which purchased land, and then held ballots whose winners were settled on small-holdings. The company then used the (protected) rents to purchase more land. The scheme was not financially sound and collapsed amidst recriminations in 1851 (Jones D 1973).The shareholders who were planted in the settlements came from the industrial cities and were expected to make a living out of their new small-holdings, which are said to have been of either two, three or four acres according to where the winners had come in the ballot. The settlement at Lincoln (clearly visible on the 1889 OS) was clearly a small one, with six or seven plots, compared with that at Charterville (Oxfordshire) for example, which had 73 plots, and therefore families (Tiller 1985). Six of the Lincoln plots, however, were almost exactly five acres, whilst the seventh (later occupied by Low Fields Farm) was just over eight. The Lincoln site offers great opportunities for archaeological research. The individual Chartists‰Û¡ÌÝå» houses were equipped with a variety of fittings and external structures which were thought essential for a respectable working family, and are thus very valuable as illustrations of social status in the mid 19th century. It is known that one of the Lincoln houses (No. 263 Brant Road) survives, and it is possible that a second house at the southern end of the RAZ incorporates the remains of a second. Both these buildings should be the subject of careful recording during repairs and alterations aimed at recovering information about the fittings of the original houses, which will give a vivid insight into what was thought to be optimum working-class living conditions. Furthermore the uses to which the plots were put and the equipment used on them will illustrate the most up-to-date horticultural thinking and will therefore also be of considerable value. Contemporary middens are likely to have been established in the yards, and these too represent valuable resources illustrating more clearly than many other forms of evidence the live-styles of these social pioneers. The large central plot, between the two groups of three four-acre plots, shown on the 1889 OS occupied by Low Fields Farm, stands aside from the remainder. It is possible that this was never part of the colony (although its location might suggest this is unlikely), but given its central position within the colony it is possible that it was intended for a school or other form of social centre, were eventually constructed at Charterville. Future work in this area should explore the possibility that this plot might contain rare and distinctive buildings relating to communal activities. A second line of thinking, however, might suggest that this was originally two plots (although somewhat smaller than the others), which had been engrossed by 1889 into a single ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáfarm‰Û¡ÌÝå». If this is true, there may be the buried remains of relatively unaltered cottages near the Brant Road, and such remains will be of great interest and should be sought in future work. It will also be interesting to date the engrossment, if that it what it is, and to research explanations for how it came about.Finally, there will certainly be interest, in future research on the site, in comparisons between the small Lincoln colony and those at the other settlements in England (Charterville (Oxfordshire), Great Dodford (Worcestershire), Heronsgate (H",Summary,The RAZ boundary is derived from the depiction of the site on the 1st edition OS map.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.29.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.29.2,

The majority of the current townscape dates from the Inter-War Period although earlier medieval and later, including 19th-century, townscape and landscape elements still have a strong influence on the character. There are large urban blocks with very limited pedestrian permeability. The sense of enclosure along Moorland Avenue with its wide streets and deep setbacks is low although elsewhere in the Character Area the narrower streets give a much stronger sense of enclosure for a suburb. Housing in the Character Area is mainly two storeys high and built in red brick. Some buildings show the influence of the Arts and Crafts style with hipped roofs with deep eaves, tall chimneys and bay windows; this can also be seen in the neighbouring Moorland Character Area.Holy Cross Church and St. Peter and St. Paul Church on Skellingthorpe Road are both landmark buildings. There is an area of vitality around the shops on Boultham Park Road roundabout and the intersection here of four of the roads which form part of the main vehicle transport network in south Lincoln gives the Character Area good connections with surrounding localities and the rest of the city. Taken together the vitality, road links, mix of shops and churches, especially of a larger scale around Boultham Park Road roundabout, and the nearby Boultham Park, partially create a feeling of a neighbourhood centre although there is no public square or urban public space.

8916b082-1161-419a-874d-84ff6df409b0,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,St. Matthew's Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe townscape of St Matthews Character Area is laid out along the simple intersection of two main roads with many cul-de-sacs leading off them. Although there are good vehicle connections to north and south via Boultham Park Road and east and west via Dixon Street, the Character Area mainly consists of separate areas of residential developments, within a Character Area that is itself surrounded by industrial areas and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáout-of-town‰Û¡ÌÝå» retail parks to north, west and east. In addition, the large impermeable urban blocks within the Character Area, the boundary to the east formed by the Witham, and areas of very different townscape make the Character Area difficult to get around on foot or to access from some parts of the city. Furthermore, these factors create a Character Area that does not have a coherent form or centre and does not have a clear, distinct character. This is in part due to the varied suburban townscape reflecting changes from early 19th century through to the 21st century, many of which have been carried out with limited reference to earlier developments. The townscape comprises a number of different periods of housing development from Late Victorian/Edwardian [1868-1918] through to Modern [1967-2009] in a variety of very different styles reflecting changing requirements and tastes. Buildings are one to two storeys in height and mainly semi-detached houses and terraces with active frontages. Earlier developments are terraced houses along Coulson Road and Waterloo Street followed by ribbon development along Boultham Park Road. Later developments tend to be self-contained residential cul-de-sacs facing inwards. St Matthews Church is a landmark building. It was a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátin tabernacle‰Û¡ÌÝå» built to serve residents of the new suburb in 1912. The Character Area is surrounded to the north, east and west by industrial areas and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáout of town‰Û¡ÌÝå» retail parks. It is difficult to move around the Character Area or to access it from some parts of the city due to the large impermeable blocks formed by the River Witham and the areas of very different townscape. Although there are good vehicle connections to the south via Boultham Park Road and east and west via Dixon Street, pedestrian connections are also limited to those roads. There is traffic noise from Boultham Park Road and Tritton Road but away from these roads the Character Area is quiet with little or no through traffic.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 5,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,74,

The last two of these churches were also, like St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, located at the town-ward end of a substantial market, and we have to ask the question whether they were all founded earlier than, or at the same time as, the market.

On the basis of other comparable examples, the tower is unlikely to represent the first phase of construction here; indeed surviving parallels for this type of tower in the city (at St Peter-at-Gowts and St Mary-le-Wigford) are attached to naves of pre-Conquest date. The tower then, might be an indication that St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s was founded before the Conquest, perhaps in the initial stages of the development of the town. This need not imply that the Eastgate market was founded this early (as it would be if such a date could be associated with St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church for example), but it might suggest that the suburb was in existence before the market place became established.",Summary,"The churchyard, which still survives in use, was bounded by properties to east and west and by the street to the south.

8b65e81e-35f5-4153-ad51-17d6498bcf69,LARA RAZ AREA,,Pottery production sites in Upper Wigford,"In the High Medieval period, pottery is known to have been manufactured along the eastern side of and to the east of the lower city (RAZ 9.39 and 9.40). Production in this area seems to have ceased in the 11th century, when the city expanded eastwards, and the assumption has been made that much pottery manufacture moved away from the city in outlying villages such as Potterhanworth (where the earliest fabrics are 13th-century in date) and Toynton All Saints (where the earliest fabrics are 14th-century in date). 13th-century wasters at Anchor Street and the Whitefriary are thought to have derived from kilns on the east side of High Street, but the discovery of later medieval kilns on the site of the Great Northern Station in 1849 and the salvage excavation of a second kiln further south in Upper Wigford, in the parish of St Mark in 1987 (ZE87), must modify our simple view of the late medieval development of the industry and should also refine our understanding of the character of the Wigford suburb at this period.Clearly all development works in these areas must be carefully supervised, with the aim of recovering archaeologically further information about this unexpected late medieval industry. In particular we need to address the relationship of the pottery production sites to the high-status houses and other contemporary complexes along the street front. The discovery that the grand houses on High Street in Wigford had noisome industrial activities in the long plots which ran eastwards towards the Old Eaa was quite unexpected, as one of the main causes, it was thought, for the shift of the pottery industry out of late medieval towns was pressure from the citizens who did not want the potters' smoke. Consequently we need to know whether these kilns were parts of the same properties, presumably let out to the potters; or were they separate properties with no means of intercommunication? If so, did the potters transport their raw materials and finished goods by water rather than using the High Street? As with the kilns in RAZ 9.39 the research agenda for the pottery types themselves has been published in Mellors (ed.) 1991, but, also like the earlier kilns, further work must focus on the social setting of the kilns and not just on the production technology.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include all the land from High Street to Sincil Dyke on the east side of High Street and from Cornhill southwards to the southern boundary of the new magistrates court buildings.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.39,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.39,

8bf9ba6c-1bdd-40f2-b78e-6b4d7c72d22c,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Boultham Moor Industrial Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌBoultham Moor Industrial Character Area is a mixed-use retail, commercial and light-industrial area located to the south of the city centre off Tritton Road, one of the arterial roads into and out of the city. The area has strong, largely impermeable boundaries to the north, east and west, and access to the area is confined to minor roads off Tritton Road. As such, permeability to surrounding areas is limited. Recent industrial development has overwritten much of the former rural and Early Industrial landscape but some traces of earlier activity remain evident such as the High Medieval route of Skellingthorpe Road and a field boundary along the southern boundary of the Character Area associated with 18th/19th-century enclosure. Ballast pits quarried alongside the railway line (opened in 1846) once occupied much of the southern half of the area with the lake in the centre being the earliest pit to be dug. Industry began to develop in the late Post-War Period and into the Modern Period. Much of the Character Area is composed of open space. There are extensive areas of car parking for the retail units and large, open yards within several of the industrial units. Starmer‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Pit Lake and Boultham Moor Wood to the east form a large piece of green space within the Character Area. There are also many deep planted and grassed verges, and areas of planting within car parking which, combined with the wooded edge along Tritton Road, result in a green environment overall. Properties in the area are either detached units or rows of attached buildings of similar plan form. Building footprints are generally rectangular and positioned deep into their plots with a large setback from the boundary. Limited doors and windows mean that there are few active frontages. Overall, there is a high solid-to-void ratio. Security fencing around the boundary of many properties further obscures the buildings from view from the road. Buildings are tall, one to two storeys in height and this, combined with the low density of buildings, the large areas of open space and wide roads, results in a low sense of enclosure and strong horizontal emphasis. The majority of buildings are of brick construction or steel frame with an outer shell in brick or aluminium. Levels of decoration are minimal on the majority of light industrial units, with the exception of coloured cladding and signage but the retail and more recent commercial units have a few more decorative elements. Tall, impermeable plot boundaries are a feature of the area and obscure views between individual sites. The public/private boundary is often heavily planted with mature trees and shrubs but there are also various types of security fencing. Boundaries between plots are often around 2 metres in height and include brick walls, wooden fencing and palisade fencing. This mixture of boundary treatments, combined with the variety of road and footpath surfaces (sometimes degraded), creates an incoherent townscape. Traffic noise in the area is substantial, particularly from Tritton Road, but vitality within the area is mostly confined to the business hours of the commercial and retail units. ‰Û¡ÌÝÌ",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 100,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,96,

8c200202-13ff-4cdf-9e1c-f74cb8afc538,LARA RAZ AREA,,The Malandry (Hospital of the Holy Innocents),"The Leper Hospital of the Holy Innocents was the third major institution (along with St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Priory and the hospital of the Holy Sepulchre RAZ 9.54) clustered around St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Green in Lower Wigford. The institution is quite well known through documentary sources (Brooks 1934-5). From the archaeological point of view also it represents a very important resource, as it has not been greatly redeveloped since the Medieval period and so preserves intact (with the exception of the cutting for the Lincoln to Grantham railway line) the complete precinct of a major Leper Hospital. There has been considerable archaeological interest in such sites in recent decades, stimulated in part by the ground-breaking study by Roberta Gilchrist (1995, 8-61). Gilchrist emphasises the symbolic importance to the medieval world of all aspects of the treatment of the sick. Illness itself was seen as a symbolic manifestation of spiritual malaise; the redemption of the sick (although not necessarily their ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácure‰Û¡ÌÝå») was largely a matter of their living a life within an institution which was a continual symbolic action; and the salvation of the remainder of society depended on their also playing their allotted symbolic role in the exchange, by ensuring that the sick received the appropriate charity. Thus it is that the great hospitals like the Malandry are prominently sited outside the gates of towns. There was little or no understanding of the concept of infectivity, so although it is often said that this segregation was a matter of hygiene, in fact it was a symbolic location intended to emphasise the liminality of those whose serious spiritual malaise was being manifested as physical sickness. Presumably it was also this social liminality which made it seem appropriate that the Master and Brethren here should have been given the responsibility for the burial of criminals executed on the gallows (themselves located physically at the boundary) at Canwick (Brook 1934-5, 163).With many religious sites we know a great deal about the plan forms and little about the populations of inmates, but with hospitals it almost tends to be the other way round. Thanks to several high-profile excavations of the graveyard populations of hospitals (for example at Chichester - Lee and Magilton 1989, and London St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Spital - Thomas et al. 1997), we know something of the range of paleo-pathologies we might expect to encounter, (and such a major hospital as Malandry will retain a large and important population, including criminals) but we are perhaps less well informed about the variations and ranges of physical layouts of hospitals. The Malandry documents speak of a great common hall, a chapel of St Magdalene and cells for the individual lepers, and within the highly symbolic framework of medieval care for the sick, the archaeological relationships between these various components will be of great interest. The structures of the hospital will also provide an important source of evidence to complement the impression given by the documentary sources that, in the later 13th and 14th centuries, many inmates had purchased their lodgings there, and that the institution had become something like a retirement home for the well-heeled (ed. Page 1906, 231).The Malandry is such a well-preserved and intact site that work here should be large-scale and attempt to elucidate the entire (surviving) graveyard population, which, because of the hospital‰Û¡ÌÝå»s function will be of very great paleolopathological importance; if at all possible the whole of the surviving buildings should be excavated at the same time. The benefits of this holistic approach have been amply demonstrated in the excavations at St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Spital in London (Thomas et al. 1997). In the case of the Malandry we also suspect that the apparently parochial church of the Holy Innocents (RAZ 9.60.17) was either within or close to the precinct, and seems to have been run by the Master and Brethren of the hospit",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn around the boundary of the so-called Malandry Closes, which were shown by Dr Cookson to be the boundary of the medieval precinct (Cookson 1843).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.56,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.56,

Clarke (a prominent local chemist, Lord Mayor and Roman Catholic). Clarke‰Û¡ÌÝå»s house was apparently based on a pre-existing house but in 1874 work began on a major rebuilding which went on for several years and some parts, including the decorative lodge, were not completed until 1883 (Elvin 1974, 8; Elvin 1981, 7; Pevsner and Harris 1989, 527). The architect was Albert Vicars. Repair and alterations in these buildings should be accompanied by programmes of recording work, which should focus not just on distinguishing Clarke‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work from the pre-existing house, but also on elucidating the way in which the house was used. The sociology of houses of this type has been a major topic of interest in recent years and can be approached very effectively through archaeological study (Girouard 1979; Airs (ed.) 2000). Future work should also address the question of why this site was chosen. The answer is not obvious, although it is said that Clarke wished to rival the new Sibthorpe family home at Canwick. It probably had little to do with the arrival of the tram terminus. The interest of the house is certainly enhanced by its location here a long way out of the city and nowhere near contemporary houses of the well-to-do (in RAZ 11.28). It was surrounded by a complex garden of parterres and water features, which we should aim to reconstruct on paper, although it is possible that some of its earthworks still survive. A research agenda for this aspect of the site can be extracted by Elliott 1988). The park was bounded by the railway on the east, Maple Street on the north, and the churchyard on the south. To the west the parkland originally included the road to Brant Broughton and went down to the river, and this may account for the elaborate decorative fish-ponds that still lie parallel with the river, but when the road was improved the park was curtailed. The lodge facing the bridge still survives, however, and is highly ornamental.

The basin was used as a dock and a boat-building yard before the establishment of the Clayton and Shuttleworth works in the 1840s (Padley 1842 map). This basin was subsequently used by Clayton and Shuttleworth to service their water transports; it was gradually filled to accommodate railway sidings during the late 19th century. The dock sides will be of interest as they will preserve important evidence for the early 19th-century ship repair industry, and also give a hint of how large the Clayton and Shuttleworth shipping operation really was. This was where the fleet of Witham steam packets was constructed in the 1830s, and consequently the buried remains of the engineering works (apparently at the south-east end of the dock) which produced these early boilers and other components will of very great interest. This works are not only of technical importance as a known early steam engineering site, but also it was probably the first such site in the city, and thus, perhaps, the real origin of Lincoln's Industrial Revolution. Any dock gates, at the north end (no such gates are known at the south end and no channel is indicated on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map) would be an important technical find, although no such gates are visible on the panorama of the Clayton and Shuttleworth works of 1869 (Hill 1974, plate 5).

In its own right the settlement will provide a valuable example of the development of a rural settlement through the Early Modern Era. A research agenda for settlements of this type is currently in production as part of the East Midlands Research Agenda process (Courtney 2001; Everson 2000), but settlement in the area has been characterised by Robert and Wrathmell (2000) and their characterisation raises several of the key questions.

By the time it is first mapped in the 18th century, the settlement is sparsely populated, with farms set high on the hillside (outside the city boundary) and these may be factors indicating a substantial depopulation brought about by the changed economic circumstances of the 14th and 15th centuries. Set against this background of the general trend of agricultural developments encouraging engrossment of farms and the creation of sheep walks, it should be of particular interest to see if the proximity of the city was the cause of any more diversified economy. Mills continue to be prominent in the Bracebridge economy, for example, and we should ask whether a surplus was being produced here for supplying the city market. The remains of these structures will be of great interest in themselves and are likely to be well preserved, potentially in water-logged conditions, making them particularly important Such a surplus of flour would, however, imply a relatively large area in the vill down to wheat, barley and rye each year, and therefore we should investigate the use of the heath-land on the cliff to establish whether some was retained as ploughland for this reason, when the sheepwalks were created. Similarly the well-documented fisheries here may have been much larger than was needed for the vill‰Û¡ÌÝå»s own purposes and we might ask if they were also supplying the city market. The village might have been supplying other more specialist products to the city as well - in the early 16th century there is a reference to a hempstall at Bracebridge - a place where hemp was grown, presumably for rope-making by city chandlers (Cameron 1985, 194). Whether the area known as suthbrakene in 1240 (Cameron 1985,194) continued to be a place where bracken was grown once the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s cloth industry had collapsed is a moot point. It is argued (RAZ 9.10) that this bracken probably represents an important source of potash for the dyeing industry in the city in the High Medieval Era. Any remains of this industrial activity (clamps and associated structures) will also be of the greatest interest in the Early Modern Era, as presumably their closure will provide dating evidence for the collapse of the industry in the city. Continuation of the industry beyond the early 14th century would be of even greater interest as it would indicate not just that some dyeing continued within the city, but also, perhaps, that other markets were found locally for this specialised product. Another factor which might make Bracebridge a particularly interesting candidate for study in this Era is the major crossing point over the Witham on the route from the city to the south-west. In the Early Modern Era the crossing probably had the effect of dragging the dwellings northwards away from the church towards the medieval North Manor.The RAZ includes the site and fabric of All Saints Church Bracebridge, a major parish church retaining important 11th-century fabric and an intact burial ground (RAZ 9.10). The church fabric itself has been the subject of much discussion (Taylor and Taylor 1965, 85-6; Stocker and Everson forthcoming) and from these descriptions detailed research agend",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the known or estimated area of tofts and crofts and the sites of the two known manorial curia.

8d6cc95c-07f9-4f28-bf4d-cc74103e9f74,LARA RAZ AREA,,Friary of the Sack and the Kyme Chantry,"The four friaries of the major orders (Augustinian, Carmelite, Dominican and Franciscan) in Lincoln represent a good group nationally, and in addition, Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s exceptionally rare example of the Friary of the Sack (extinct by 1307) continued in religious use in the early part of the Early Modern Era. The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In the course of the final two centuries of their existence we should be interested in adaptations to the churches and other claustral buildings which may cast light on the changing attitudes of the orders to their rules and to their relationship with the secular world. In the post-Dissolution period these sites retain considerable interest. Their archaeology should cast light on the attitudes of the new secular owners to the old religion; was it deliberately denigrated or were its monuments treated with dignity and respect? In the case of the Carmelite Friary and St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Conduit we may have rare evidence for the latter attitude. In all of these cases we must be aware that the fraternal buildings are likely to have converted for secular uses at the Dissolution. Little is known about these conversions in Lincoln or elsewhere and the chance should be taken to study this important aspect of early modern archaeology as well as the archaeology of these Friaries themselves.Although a rare category of site, the Friary of the Sack in Lincoln had been extinguished by 1307. The site then passed to the Dean and Chapter who established a poorly understood group of priests here. The arrangement was regularised, and the responsibility lifted from the Dean and Chapter, with the foundation of a more conventional-looking chantry college by the Cantilupe family in 1358 (Hill 1948, 151). It seems likely, therefore, that the church here survived in use following the re-appropriation of the site and the archaeology of these various conversions will be of great interest. The church itself was a grand stone building and Willson left a record that it was ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáof the same style as the surviving building at the Greyfriary‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Soc. Ants. Ms. 786/5 p.101). This building would be an important find, but so would information about the fate of the remainder of the friary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s buildings, which must have been turned over to secular purposes similar to the warehouses which the Abbot of Barlings had proposed in 1307. It is possible, however, that some of the tenements which were originally granted to the friary survived relatively little changed as tenements on the boundary of the friary throughout its life. This sequence of events is extremely unusual. Many pre-Reformation dissolutions resulted in the secularisation of the site, yet here it was clearly felt that commercial exploitation of the former conventual church was inappropriate, even though such uses might be entertained for the conventual buildings. In such circumstances an archaeological investigation of the whole site would reveal whether or not the buildings were redeveloped as a single block by a single owner (presumably the City Council) or whether they were developed piecemeal by many new landlords or tenants. Either way we would gain a very valuable insight into the City Council‰Û¡ÌÝå»s role in the late Middle Ages as an agent of regeneration in peripheral areas like this, which were suffering depopulation and economic collapse.The southern part of the site may be waterlogged, opening up important possibilities for study of organic deposits and for environmental sampling, and these activities should play a full part in future work on the site.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn around the presumed precinct boundary of the Sack Friars site. None of the boundary points is securely known and the mapped RAZ is based on elimination of surrounding properties. We can presume, however, that it was an approximately rectangular precinct, as it was said to be 540 x 420 feet in dimension in the 13th century (ed.

8de153be-b7a7-420d-b1ab-1e579298ab52,LARA RAZ AREA,,Riparian deposits,"Samples taken from the river in the centre of the Roman and medieval city indicate that natural deposits here can provide crucial information about the Early Medieval Era as they can about all other eras, and sampling strategies should include consideration of the behaviour of the river at this important transitional period. At present it is known that water levels in the Witham basin rose slowly between the 5th and 9th centuries and that this brought about a stagnant river with many pools (Wilkinson 1986-7, 54). The precise rate of water-level rise and the extent of marginal areas flooded remain uncertain and further detailed paleo-environmental work will help here. The riverside environment so defined would have been useful for fishing and fowling, and some evidence for such forms of exploitation should also be sought, wherever an opportunity presents itself along all the boundaries of RAZ 8.5. We should not forget, either, that we have made a case for the ritual significance of the pool from the Iron Age to the late Roman period and, although ideologies are likely to have changed, it is also likely that the pool would continue to attract a measure of ritual respect. ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáBog bodies‰Û¡ÌÝå» of this date are found on the continent and we have some finds from lower down the Witham, suggesting that votive deposition was undertaken in this period, as it had been both before and afterwards (Stocker and Everson 2003). The most interesting of these votive artefacts are the two 8th-century finds from the river near Fiskerton; the finely-worked silver hanging bowl (now vanished) and the famous ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáWitham Pins‰Û¡ÌÝå», now in the British Museum. These two artefacts, and perhaps also the four whetstones from Naomi Field‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1981 Fiskerton excavations (Field nd. 13), indicate that the tradition of making votive deposits in the river was still current in the Middle Saxon period, and, although there have been no artefacts of this date from Lincoln itself, such artefacts should be expected during the course of earth removals within this RAZ.",Summary,"The RAZ is defined here, as previously, by the boundary between the alluvium and the river terraces along the approximate line of the 5m contour.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,8.5,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,8.5,

8e00be36-4073-4f1f-aa24-bc7d4d66d2af,LARA RAZ AREA,,"Working class housing of the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Newport, the Bail, the lower city and Wigford.","The housing conditions for the working classes in the Industrial Era seem to have shown a continuous improvement. At the start of the great growth of population in the 1750s working class families, presumably mostly immigrants into the city, were housed in poor-quality accommodation squeezed into gaps between, and closes behind, the existing street-fronts. This made many existing property-owners or tenants minor landlords. These properties became increasingly scandalous and it was not until the second half of the 19th century that serious steps were taken to remedy the situation through the construction of terraces of brick-built houses on new land (RAZ 11.26). This RAZ, however, deals with the intermediate working-class housing of the century or so between 1750 and 1850. We are very fortunate in the upper city both to have such relatively complete survival of domestic building of this date, along with their associated documents, and to have this resource so comprehensively and usefully studied (Jones et al. 1984 -1996). These documents apply mostly to the Close houses themselves (RAZ 11.27 below) but the more modest, commercial, buildings along Bailgate and their documentation have also been studied. The buildings along and behind Bailgate saw dramatic changes in their function and status in the Industrial Era. Like all of the areas of the city retained as housing since the Early Modern Era, they saw a dramatic increase in the density of occupation from 1750-1850. Many of the shops along Bailgate itself remained the family lodgings of the trading classes, but increasingly gaps in the street fronts were filled with new building and, especially, behind the street front, on Chapel Lane, Westgate and St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane, small terraces, rows and yards were built to accommodate poor tenants. There was also infilling in Newport. The 1819 Padley map shows little change from the previous Era, but by the time of the 1842 map, the margins of the old market street itself had become colonised by small buildings. Being quite closely dated, these structures are of considerable interest. These encroachments on to what had once been market place might have their origins in market stall holders, whose stalls eventually became permanent, but given the apparent failure of the market, it is perhaps more likely that they represent ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásquatter‰Û¡ÌÝå» occupation on the public road - an example of the privatisation of public assets by the lower orders of society.This trend towards ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáinfilling‰Û¡ÌÝå» the yards and orchards behind the main street-fronts with yards and rows with houses of inferior quality can be seen right across the city, in all those areas which had remained in occupation at the end of the Early Modern Era. Conditions in these yards were poor, but they probably varied across the city, and a comparison between such yards in one area of the city and another will be of considerable archaeological interest. The most notorious of these areas of cheap ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáinfill‰Û¡ÌÝå» accommodation were Gadsby‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Court and the area around it in St Swithin's parish, where it was said in 1847 that 2 rooms were occupied by 20 people (Hill 1974, 156-9). Holland's Row and Gourley's Row were also infilling, in what we think was the Newland market place (Cameron 1985, 74 - RAZ 9.19; 10.19), though it is less clear that it was particularly insalubrious (pace Hill 1974, 179-9). In 1865 Sincil Street was said to be particularly densely occupied as it had ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácourts within courts‰Û¡ÌÝå» and the area behind the street front around High Bridge and Waterside South was said to be ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáa conglomerate mass of ill-built dwellings stables and slaughter houses' (Hill 1974, 165). At this date, however, there were also black-spots on the marginal land on the hill slope in St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish, at Ashton‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Court in St Peter-at-Gowts parish, and St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish contained the notorious Abraham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Passage and Gadsby‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Row as well as Watson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Court (Hill 1974, 127-8). These yards and rows have not been",Summary,"The RAZ is defined by the eastern and western edges of the dense grouping of courts and yards which extended back on each side of High Street and which is mapped on the 1st edition OS map. It extends from Newport southwards to the Sincil Dyke, although it is not continuous on either side of High Street for the whole length. The western boundary follows a complex route through the back streets of the city including everything east of Chapel Lane, St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane, south-east of Drury Lane, east of Michaelgate and Hungate as far south as Park Street. The area between Park Street and the river is included within this RAZ and the boundary then follows a line intermediate between the High Street and Brayford quayside and then south to Sincil Dyke. On the east side of the city the boundary includes everything to the west of the Close Wall in the Bail and then west of Danesgate. The RAZ includes the block of building in Butwerk bounded by Monks Road, Rosemary Lane and St Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street and everything west of the city wall south to the river. It then crosses the river to include everything west of Melville Street/Canwick Road as far south as Oxford Street. The boundary is then drawn west along the railway boundary along Oxford Street to join a line which runs north-south behind the properties extending back from the east side of High Street as far south as Great Gowt and then on to St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. N.B. the limits of this housing are partly indicated by the areas marked as occupied by 1851 on Wright‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of the development of Lincoln (Wright 1982, fig.20).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.25,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.25,
8e9db6e2-1d69-47f1-847b-e873796499e7,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Brant Road Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌBrant Road Character Area is a large suburban area lying in the Witham Valley at the base of the limestone escarpment either side of Brant Road approximately 4km to the south of Lincoln City Centre. The area, now amalgamated within the City of Lincoln, was once within the parish of Bracebridge lying to the south of the city limits.Much of the land within the Character Area remained open until it was developed for housing during the Modern period. The alignment of some field boundaries associated with the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s enclosure during the Early Modern period are retained within the layout of the townscape. In addition, former field boundaries and a single house survive from a former 19th century Chartist colony located in the south of the Character Area.Housing consists of a series of residential developments, composed of one or a number of build units, constructed during the Modern [1967-2008 AD] period. Each residential build unit has an identifiable and largely consistent architectural style. Properties within each development are built around a series of unconnected cul-de-sacs and closes, which are arranged in varying patterns. Houses turn their backs on adjacent areas and roads, and face in towards the interior of development units, leading in inactive fronts or backs of properties being exposed, leading to a lower sense of security.There is a regular overall grain of open space and buildings throughout much of the Character Area, with small buildings set within medium/small sized plots, except around short rows of housing where plots decrease in size or are amalgamated into communal gardens. Plots are indistinctly defined to the front, reducing the sense of enclosure along many streets. However, the overall sense of enclosure remains medium/high for a suburb, due to a medium/high building density and strong building lines along streets.Despite the variety of build units within the area, many aspects of the townscape are strongly coherent across the whole Character Area, including building scale, form, position on plot, and to a lesser extent decoration. Properties are mostly 2 storeys in height or are bungalows, and are commonly detached or semi-detached properties. Houses are plain in decoration, with simple rendered /clad panels on earlier houses and brickwork/synthetic stone decorative features on more recent properties. Structural projections are frequent on properties in the area.

8ecdeb4d-116e-468f-920d-b72c90d3fa6e,LARA RAZ AREA,,Monks' Abbey (Benedictine Priory of St Mary Magdalene); the monastic precinct,"Viewed simply as a small monastic cell of the great Benedictine Abbey of St Mary at York, Monks' Abbey it is of considerable rarity. Very few such cells have standing buildings like those here which permit us to understand the round of services maintained by the small colony of monks. The fabric of the ruins is, then, of great sensitivity and importance and all works here must be accompanied by an archaeological recording programme. Elevation drawings and other records in Padley 1851 are valuable, but modern elevations should be produced as circumstances permit. The nature of the site surrounding the standing ruins is very little known, although trial work at MA83 did reveal the presence of medieval archaeology (Stocker 1984a). Future research questions on the site should be directed towards understanding not only the plan of structures, but also the very distinctive religious life which must have taken place here. Was a round of daily service maintained, within the formal setting of a cloister, or was this rather a house more like a monastic farm, where the commercial activities of the agricultural estate took precedence over the Rule? Even though the house had no monks at all in residence at certain stages, St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s York were still very reluctant to let the site go - it was too valuable an estate. The periods when the church was not used for the monastic routine should show in the archaeology of the church itself and in its relationship to the cell buildings round about.In addition to these well-framed aspects of archaeological importance, there is a group of more intangible questions surrounding Monks' Abbey. Ever since Leland recorded that he had heard that this was the site of St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 7th-century monastery known as Icanhoe (ed. Toulmin Smith 1964, I, 30), rumours have existed that this was an early church site. Furthermore, we have already seen that the estate in which it sits might be the successor to a major Roman estate based on the Greetwell Villa (RAZ 7.23) and it is occasionally proposed that early monastic sites are the direct descendants of Roman estates. The Monks' Abbey sits at the northern end of the Stamp End causeway (RAZ 9.1, 9.2), which is one of a group of such causeways across the Witham, which frequently do have early church sites adjacent to their northern ends (as at Bardney, South Kyme and possibly Tattershall) (Stocker and Everson 2003). Like the other ritual causeways of the Witham valley, the Stamp End causeway has a well-attested group of metalwork finds associated with it, which suggests that it marked and important ritual site from the Bronze Age through to the medieval Era (RAZs 5.2, 6.4, 7.13, 8.3.2, 9.1) and an early church site at Monks' Abbey would fit very neatly into this sequence of ritual sites, making it similar to the other know sites in the valley. Several of the swords found at the Stamp End causeway are medieval in date, showing that this type of ritual deposition continued during the documented life of the cell. Finally, another category of evidence altogether might also point towards the presence of an important early church here, i.e. the establishment of a major market nearby, east of the city, prior to the later 11th century (The Baggerholme market - RAZ 9.18). Such markets are frequently associated with early monastic foundations and, on the face of it, the market might be taken as further circumstantial evidence for the presence of any early church. However, it must be said that there is very little historical documentation which can be used to support any claim that there was an early church site here. It has been presumed that the foundation of the cell itself was made in the late 11th century, when the land forming the Monks estate was granted to the Abbey of St Mary York by Romfar, a citizen of Lincoln (Hill 1948, 339). The relevant documents make it clear, however, that there was already a chapel dedicated to St Mary on this land when Romfar made his g",Summary,"The boundaries of the monastic precinct are unknown. The RAZ area chosen, defined approximately by Tempest Street, Spa Street, Monks Road and Winn Street, includes a realistic area within which we might expect to find at least the core of the cell in the High Medieval Era. This is not to say, however, that the main concentration of buildings at earlier dates were in this area.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.55.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.55.1,

Shortly afterwards, however, land was purchased on a site south-east of the Castle and the main building, designed by John Carr of York, was opened in 1777. This building still survives and is recognised as an important early example of a purpose-built hospital building and it belongs to a class of buildings which have been the subject of a recent thematic study, which can serve as a research agenda for the topic (ed. Richardson, 1998). The original building needs to be disentangled through fabric recording and its architectural details all need detailed recording during repair or alteration. We should be particularly interested in the extent to which contemporary ideas about the origins of illness, and about the role played in cure by environmental factors, played a part in Carr‰Û¡ÌÝå»s original design. The hospital was deliberately sited in extensive grounds that were elaborately landscaped. This landscaped and terraced garden is itself of interest as a mid-18th century layout and its various elements should be surveyed to establish how much of the original design survives. Beyond its interest in the history of garden design, however, the garden is of additional importance because it is likely that initial design was intended to play an active part in cures available at the hospital, not only through producing herbs for remedies, but also because walking in the garden would have been prescribed as treatments for certain types of illness including mental afflictions. This means that comparisons between the layout and planting of this garden and other Victorian gardens in the city (eg, RAZ 11.28; 11.19.2; 11.20; 11.34 etc) will be particularly interesting. A basic research agenda for the topic as a whole can be extracted from Elliott 1986. Despite being purpose-built (and despite having an added operating theatre - which should be a particular target for investigation in future work) this building suffered from poor location within the city and a suspect water supply (Hill 1974, 151). Eventually the hospital was moved to the modern site in Sewell Road in the 1870s.",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the boundary of the garden as depicted on the 1887 O.S. map.

8fa07cca-e36e-42a4-b5ee-2f0a50e5e546,LARA RAZ AREA,,Banking industry,"It is no coincidence that Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s first bank was founded by Richard Ellison, the lessee of the Fossdyke. His fortune depended on business in Lincoln itself being put on a stable commercial footing so that grain merchants and others using his canal could trade on a proper footing. Thus Smith, Ellison and Co were founded in 1775 (Wright 1984, 67), on the site of the modern Natwest Bank, just north of Stonebow. In 1806 the Boston-based bank of Sheath & Sons joined with John Steel and John Wray to open a rival branch in Lincoln, but they did not capture a sizeable part of the market and it was not until the establishment of the Lincoln Trustee Savings Bank in 1816 that Smith & Ellison saw serious competition. In 1835 these two establishments were joined by the Lincoln and Lindsey Bank. In 1835 the Hull Banking Co also opened a branch in Lincoln (Wright 1982, 68). In 1895 the Peacock Bank, based in Sleaford, Newark and Bourne opened a Lincoln office (Wright 1982, 194), although all of these banks had been merged with the large, London-based, groupings by 1914. Interesting fabric of several banks has survived in the city: Smith & Ellison‰Û¡ÌÝå»s on the corner of Mint Street and High Street is of 1883 by John Gibson. As an early provincial bank this site merits careful investigation below and above ground. Because it was a bank set up with the specific purpose of servicing the developing local trading community, and must have been (at least in part) a community driven operation, we might expect some individualised features not found at other, later, banks. The building of 1883 belongs to a class of large late-Victorian banks of which there are several other examples in Lincoln and with which it should be compared. On the corner of Guildhall Street and High Street, the modern HSBC is the former headquarters of the Lincoln and Lindsey Bank of 1893, and the building represents an important example of bank design of that date (by William Watkins - Burgess 1990, 41). In 1833, however, the bank was originally established in an existing building at 182-5 High Street, and there we should be interested in any adaptations were thought necessary to the building to make it suitable for its new purposes. On the corner of St Benedict‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Square and High Street stands the former Capital and Counties Bank (modern Lloyd‰Û¡ÌÝå»s/TSB Bank) by William Mortimer (a Lincoln architect) of 1901/3. This is a purpose-built bank of a well-known type and should be compared with other Lincoln examples of the type, and with others nationally. The elaborate terracotta faÌÎå_ade at 191 High Street (currently River Island) marks Peacock and Wilson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s new Bank designed in 1897 by William Watkins (Burgess 1990, 42). This building, however, did not start life as a bank as Peacock and Wilson first set up business in a shop on this site in 1895 (Directory). Is the surviving building wholly of 1897 or is it a conversion of the earlier building? The large and ornate gothic Midland Bank Company building (late Barclay‰Û¡ÌÝå»s) of 1873, formerly on the south corner of Cornhill and High Street, is now only represented by buried remains, although it appears to have been the earliest of the grandiose Victorian banks. It was taken over by the Stamford, Boston and Spalding Bank c.1885 and by Barclay‰Û¡ÌÝå»s before 1913. This building is also of interest as it is reported to have served as a telephone exchange in the 1880s. Unfortunately little is known about this phase in the building‰Û¡ÌÝå»s life and any further information about this important secondary function would be very welcome. The Lincoln Trustee Savings Bank moved to 12 Bank Street in 1825 and, like the Midland Bank, it is now represented only by buried remains. In this case, however, the building was not a purpose-built bank and so any buried remains will demonstrate the changes deemed necessary to convert a domestic building for these purposes.

The presence of the potters' workshop at this early period is clearly signalled by the street-name ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáPottergate‰Û¡ÌÝå» (a name first recorded in 1179-84 - Cameron 1985, 90-1), which was one of the roads which led down the hill towards the workshops. The potters were presumably exploiting the band of clay that outcrops at the base of the cliff, below the spring-line and probably also the water which came from the springs themselves. The kilns are of great importance for the ceramic history of the area, not least because we know that they went out of use early, and if any existed east of Holgate they will have a valuable TAQ of 1238, when the site was appropriated by the Blackfriars. Although one kiln site has been partially excavated (SES97, TC93, TCA94), we know little about the context of the kilns. Consequently further work might focus not just on the kiln sites themselves, but on their broader setting. The kilns can be predicted to occur in a line running parallel with the cliffs eastwards from the Sessions House, but we remain unsure about which streets the properties which contained them fronted on to. They could have been within properties which faced on to Pottergate, Holgate or Monks Road. Whilst we know quite a lot about kiln technology of this date (and several kilns of this date have been excavated in Lincoln), we still know virtually nothing about the character of other structures within the kiln site, and, crucially, we cannot say whether the kilns were located on individual burgage plots, or within industrial compounds. The two possible models represent two entirely different models for the development of the industry. A research framework for pottery types of the sort produced at these kilns has been published by Mellor (1994, esp. p. 69).",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries have been drawn to include the lower parts of the scarp face of the hill, on the assumption that the kilns were based as close to this zone of clay-extraction as possible. The northern boundary follows the line of the terrace below the Art College from the city wall (RAZ 9.50.1) as far eastwards as the Butwerk boundary (RAZ 9.51.2). The southern boundary (drawn between the same two points east and west) is a line which runs behind the presumed properties running back northwards from the medieval predecessor to Monks Road. The southern boundary of the RAZ has made the assumption that there was no connection between the pottery kilns on the hill-side and the tenements along Baggeholme Road (Monks Road), but this may be erroneous and the RAZ boundary could easily be drawn to include the street front and the tenements along it. At the north-eastern corner of Baggeholme Road (Monks Road), however, the church of St Rumbold (9.60.9) occupied the street front and there is no sign that the site was previously occupied by the pottery industry.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.40.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.40.1,

911431e0-dd8c-40bc-af6c-75cddf43198d,LARA RAZ AREA,,Lincoln common fields,"As Dr Vince shows (chapter 9a) the city fields lay exclusively to the north and east of the walled city; dwellers in Wigford apparently had no arable at all. Hill (1948, 331) thought that the people of Wigford were ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáso wholly urban in origin they never felt the need for it‰Û¡ÌÝå». This short observation goes to the heart of our whole understanding of urbanism in medieval Lincoln. What was it about the suburb of Wigford in particular which meant that dwellers there wanted no share of the arable? And what does this important distinction between Wigford and the walled city imply about the distribution of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s population through its different parts. Was Wigford in origin just a market place used by people who actually lived (and had allocations of land) elsewhere? This would cohere with the recent proposals that Wigford had its origins in a beach-market which only became a permanent settlement, with churches, in the later 10th century (above chapter 9a; Stocker 2000). If this is a correct understanding it would imply that the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s fields were laid out before the end of the 10th century; otherwise, presumably, the men of Wigford would have been as entitled to land there as dwellers on the north bank. In its turn, this would suggest that the fields were laid out at a relatively early date in the development of the urban centre; before, for example, the suburbs of Newport and Eastgate were laid out (in the 11th century according to Dr Vince). Equally, this should mean that some of the most important information about the origins of open field agriculture should be found below the suburbs, where parts of the field must have been taken out of use early on. In fact the Lincoln fields cannot be seen in isolation, as they shared boundaries with the adjoining parishes of Burton, Riseholme, Nettleham and Greetwell, all of which appear to be nucleated settlements of the type which might represent a great re-planning of the Lindsey landscape around nucleated, parochial, settlements with open fields, which seems to be a late 9th- or 10th-century phenomenon (Everson et al. 1991, 13-28; Everson and Stocker 1999, 76-9; Stocker and Everson forthcoming).The archaeology of the fields is likely to be rather coarse and uninformative on a small scale. The most informative studies will be those conducted on air photos taken before the redevelopment of the northern part of the fields for housing. Some of these show evidence for ridge and furrow and, using early mapping and the Enclosure Award, it may be possible to develop a picture of the field system in its final stages. A research agenda for such systems has been defined by D. Hall (1994). Excavation may be a less effective technique of exploration here, but even so, soil analyses from widely scattered sites in the fields may provide useful information about relative fertility and, over time, the distribution patterns of pottery may give some indication about manuring at different periods. It is likely that many boundary stones were placed in the Lincoln fields, as they were in all such systems, but it is equally likely that these would have been simple rough boulders and thus not easily spotted in the modern urban environment. The fields will have contained a variety of other structures, besides soil platforms. All open field systems contained ephemeral sheds for shelter and the storage of tools, as well as earthwork and timber structures to support stands for peas and beans etc. The known locations of a number of windmills in the fields of Lincoln are known (RAZs 9.42, 9.43, 9.44), but there are several others which are mentioned and whose locations may come to light during development work within this RAZ. These un-located mills include the Chapter Mills (Cameron 1985, 186) and the Windmill outside Newport, the latter documented from as early as 1280 (Cameron 1985, 189) and perhaps identical with the Mill Hill in the north field (Ibid. 184). It is debatable whether this description c",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the whole area of the original three-field system of Lincoln field. It therefore includes the land below what are presumed to be the later suburbs of Newport and Eastgate. Although East Field and North Field were always primarily arable in rotation with pasture, this was true only of parts of Low Field (to the west), which, although part of the three-field rotation, were nevertheless in permanent pasture. This RAZ, therefore includes the whole of RAZ 9.8.2 . Although Hill believed (1948, 331) that the Monks Leas estate (RAZ 9.8.5) was also considered to part of the open fields of Lincoln, the various disputes with the city suggest that this is unlikely. This area seems to have been private enclosed land from at least the 11th or early 12th century onwards on which the citizens tried to maintain their common grazing rights.

920a2f7b-24d1-4026-b8f6-eb955f7ecfa8,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Glebe Park Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌGlebe Park Character Area is a large suburban area lying approximately 2km north east of Lincoln city centre, composed of two residential developments, which illustrate changing attitudes and approaches to the construction of private residential housing estates in the mid to latter part of the 20th century.The Character Area lies on the outskirts of the city between two Roman roads leading to the villages of Nettleham and Wragby. The southern boundary of the Character Area follows the line of the former boundary line between Nettleham Parish and City of Lincoln. Residential development has overwritten much of the former landscape. However, the area contains many traces of its rural past, including a former 18th-century farmhouse and lines of field boundaries associated with the 18/19th-century enclosure of land.Urban blocks are large and irregular in shape. Movement across the area is restricted to Wolsey Way and footpaths, as access to build units is via an irregular and sinuous branching pattern of cul-de-sacs and closes. Pedestrian paths provide good access between development units and through to neighbouring Character Areas. Although well maintained, paths run to the rear of houses, and are often bordered by high garden fencing giving a feeling of enclosure and lack of security. Houses in the Character Area turn their backs on surrounding areas, and are consequently poorly connected with neighbouring areas.The form and style of residential properties vary throughout the Character Area, but are generally highly coherent within build units. However, properties within the same build unit are often differentiated from neighbouring houses through the varying use of projections or decoration.Despite variation between development units, many aspects of the townscape are strongly coherent in character. There is a medium-to-high density of residential housing, the majority of which consists of semi-detached or detached bungalows or two-storey properties. Properties are arranged broadly parallel to streets, which form an irregular and sinuous pattern of cul-de-sacs and closes.Houses face the road, and are built in the centre/front of plots and are mostly set back 5-10m from the footway with private driveways and gardens. Public/private boundaries to the front of properties are frequently indistinct. Houses have active front faÌÎå_ades and medium-to-high solid-to-void ratios with regular horizontal windows. Properties are generally plain in appearance and are built of brick and other small-scale materials. Roofs are mostly pitched and gabled with concrete tiles. Large and often poorly delineated setbacks, low building height, medium-to-high building density, and wide residential roads combine to produce an open sense of enclosure and a horizontal emphasis throughout much of the Character Area.Developments that are more recent show greater diversity in character, and contrast with earlier more uniform developments. The layout of streets and properties, and the form, size and decoration of buildings are more variable in recent developments, illustrating a move by modern developers to design and construct more individual properties from the outset. Higher building density and the use of common architectural components, materials, and fixtures and fittings in development units demonstrate the economies of scale of mass residential estates, and their construction with a restricted set of building materials.Roads are surfaced with tarmac, and are mostly 2 lanes in width, except for wider connecting through roads.The Character Area is entirely suburban in character and lacks any public buildings, square or any landmark buildings. Public and open space in the Character Area consists of residential streets, areas of open grassland, verges and a flood soak-away area.There are good wide-ranging rural views across fields from the north east of the Character Area.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 43,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,5,

The church was rebuilt in 1786 and the remains of this building need to be compared in detail with the contemporary buildings at St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Peter Eastgate. This little building, like its fellows, can tell us a great deal about late-Georgian piety before the great doctrinal debates of the 19th century. The excavation records of the late 18th-century building can also be profitably compared with the new church on the site, built in 1877-8 (to designs by A. Blomfield), to see the manner in which new doctrinal ideas were influencing the design and furnishing of churches in the 1870s. Further excavation work on the site can only be undertaken on the outlying parts of the burial ground but, nevertheless, such work does have an important role to play in setting the excavated population in some meaningful context. This is as true of the Industrial Era as of earlier ones. The graveyard continued in use until the 1850s and burials from this graveyard will be particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered a deterioration in their circumstances. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn from the depiction of the churchyard on the 1st edition O.S. Map.

924b7b5f-2954-4644-a39f-5d11c20fb410,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Great Northern Terrace Industrial Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌGreat Northern Terrace Character Area is a mixed-use area to the east of the city centre including retail, industrial, residential and recreation uses. Its use for industry and large out of town retail has been influenced by its position on the floodplain in the River Witham valley as this has left the area relatively undeveloped in comparison with other areas in such close proximity to the city centre.Much of the former rural character of the area has been overwritten by successive phases of industrial development since the early Industrial Period. Served by the river and later railway, formerly marginal open land within the Character Area was the ideal location for industries. Buildings in the current townscape illustrate one of the most significant phases of industrial growth of the city during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The phase of growth changed the townscape of the city as a whole, encouraging residential development and the expansion of Lincoln as a commercial centre. The area remains the industrial heart of Lincoln, with many earlier buildings adapted for use by modern industries as well as offices.The area is bordered and divided by strong impermeable features such as three railway lines and a river, leading to large urban blocks and poor connectivity. Within urban blocks, development is mainly arranged around cul-de-sacs. Buildings are large in scale with regular, rectangular footprints. Properties are often one very tall storey in height to accommodate manufacturing and storage functions. The large building footprints, wide roads, and large areas of open space around buildings create a horizontal emphasis overall. Buildings are predominantly detached and situated in their own plots, but there are also a few rows of attached properties, and some groups of buildings within industrial estates. Several of the largest buildings are subdivided for multiple occupation. The majority of buildings are individual in design and of solid brick construction or steel frame with a variety of other materials for cladding. The solid brick examples tend to be the earlier warehouse buildings. Properties are generally plain, with limited decoration, and few windows and doors. Many older buildings have been converted from industrial to office and residential use. Industrial units have high boundaries around the perimeter of the plot in a variety of materials. The public/private boundary between retail/commercial units and the road tends to be more permeable and less clearly defined. There are also many open spaces, including extensive areas of car parking within plots, yards and green spaces such as the river and drain corridors, and grass and planted verges. Vitality is fairly high due to the numbers of staff and visitors using the area but this is mainly confined to business hours. Some leisure-related uses have extended opening hours. The Character Area is situated between built-up areas of the city and its rural fringe. As a result there are both rural views along the waterways and onto the south escarpment and urban views to the north onto the Cathedral and upper city on the north escarpment.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 20,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,65,

92b505ea-dcfc-4ff0-8f64-9d70b4d6b1c3,LARA RAZ AREA,,Prisons,"Until 1809 the City Gaol was located in the stone-built building (of uncertain date) adjacent to the Stonebow on the east (Hill 1966, 187; Nowell 2001). Nothing seems to be known of the way in which this building functioned as a prison. Detailed fabric survey is essential not just to establish the building‰Û¡ÌÝå»s date, but also to understand how it functioned as a prison and whether it was originally designed for such a purpose. The result of this study can then be compared, profitably, to a study of the buried remains of the city prison which replaced it, built in 1805-9 behind the new Sessions House. As a newly-equipped building built just before the age of prison reform it will have a lot to tell us about prison conditions in the Napoleonic period. The City Gaol was replaced in 1844-5 by a new gaol on the same site, which also contained the City Police Station (RCHME 1997 - see below and RAZ 11.64)The purpose-built prison in the Castle, however, is earlier in date than the City Gaol building, and, by the start of the Industrial Era, it had become much the most significant prison complex in the county. As well as the forthcoming volume dedicated to the site (ed. Lindley forthcoming), a Conservation Plan has been produced for Lincoln Castle (Hayfield 2000). These volumes provide a much more detailed research agenda than is possible here and the following supplementary information is provided to help guide future archaeological planning. County justice and administration remained focused on two halls within the enclosure, as it had been in earlier eras (RAZ 9.48; 10.48), but during the Industrial Era both were replaced with fine new buildings, both of which represent enormous resources of information for understanding the development of county administration and justice. The new prison building was built (to designs by William Lumby) in 1787 to replace the ramshackle group north-west of the east gate. The importance of this building lies not just in the significance of its architect, but also because it represents precisely the stage of development in the housing and management of prisoners which had been reached by the late 18th century. It retains many of its original interior features and must be recorded in detail during the process of repair and restoration. Within half a century the new prison was completely redesigned, however, in line with the new thinking represented by the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáSeparate‰Û¡ÌÝå» or ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáPentonville‰Û¡ÌÝå» system (advocating total solitary confinement for most categories of prisoners - Nowell 2001). An entirely new cell block with ancillary buildings was constructed in 1847-8, including the melancholy chapel, and a remarkable segregated exercise yard was built to the south (to designs by W.A. Nicholson & Goddard). This building is also of great importance nationally as it represents a very well-preserved example of a type of prison which was replaced almost everywhere else by more humane regimes. In both the Lumby building and the extension, every detail, no matter how small, is telling and important and needs full recording during the process of repair and restoration. The building also deserves direct comparison with Nicholson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s rebuilding of the City Prison (1844-5), which was also designed using ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáseparate‰Û¡ÌÝå» principles, to draw out the similarities and contrasts between the experiences of prisoners under the two jurisdictions. As a pair of institutions illustrating the development of prison regimes at a crucial moment, we must be interested in differences at both sites between the layout of buildings of the late 18th or early 19th century and the 1840s. We should also explore the extent of segregation by class, by sex or by both. Were criminals awaiting trial, debtors and the condemned awaiting execution treated differently and, if so, in what ways? The Castle gaol remained occupied until 1878, although many inmates had been transferred to the new gaol on Greetwell Road (below) after 1869.

The parish, already greatly reduced in size by the development of the Franciscan Friary (RAZ 9.60.41), was reported as having less than 10 inhabitants in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287), but seems to have been united with St Swithin before the 1549 Act. The church was one of those liquidated by the City Council in 1535 (Stocker 1990, 20), but the orders excepted the chancel, as though it was intended to retain that part of the building for some other function. This is an interesting matter and the conversion of the chancel into some use, secular or otherwise, should be investigated in future archaeological work. As the church was destroyed a year or two before the Reformation, it will provide a good opportunity to explore the fabric and layout of a minor church on its eve, and it may cast light on the question of whether support for the Old Religion was in decline in the town, or whether it had retained its former popularity (Duffy 1992). The graveyard population, nicely sealed by the demolition in 1535, is likely to be of considerable interest, as we remain unsure whether this was a marginal parish, similar to that of St George (RAZ 10.60.40), or, because it included parts of Clasketgate and Silver Street, it might have contained more prosperous individuals.",Summary,"The site of the churchyard is known.

92ced356-1a4a-4d0b-8f45-c7754e57cdef,LARA RAZ AREA,,Electricity production industry,"Lincoln's first power station was built on Brayford Wharf North by Lincoln Corporation in 1898, with a capacity of 156KW in three 'Willans-type quick revolution' generating sets (Herridge 1999, No.5011). The venture was a great success and capacity was soon increased by the addition, in 1913, of new machinery housed in a large building to the north. Both the original building on the wharf frontage and the large 1913 structure at the rear still stand and are important and rare survivals of a civic plant of this date. Fabric study will reveal evidence for the machinery originally mounted here and the buildings must be recorded before repair or development. The Brayford site proved awkward, however; it was limited by lack of ground space and a connection to the railway to bring in coal and remove ash, as well as the unsuitability of sluggish Brayford Pool water for cooling. Consequently generation was transferred to Spa Road when Clayton and Shuttleworth's power station was purchased in 1917. This short period of operation (1898-1917) makes the surviving Lincoln buildings more important. It implies that they were unaffected by any technological upgrading later than 1917 and therefore represent a relatively unaltered example of this type of electricity generating station from the period of the growth of the industry. The relationship between the Corporation electricity works and the tram system has yet to be elucidated. Presumably the trams (electrified in 1905 - RAZ 11.9) drew their power from this station, and we should establish whether this required installation of additional capacity. A full research agenda for such sites is provided by the Step 1 Report (Trueman 1994). The standing electricity generating station at Spa Road (Herridge 1999, No.5056) was built between 1945 and 1948, but it replaced the Clayton and Shuttleworth station, purchased by the City Council in 1917 (Herridge 1999, No.5228). Little seems to be known of the original power plant on this site and future research work on the site should be aimed at understanding what kind of plant the City Council purchased from Clayton and Shuttleworth‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. It may have been an early private station and therefore of some technical interest, and furthermore it is likely that alterations and perhaps enhancements will have been necessary in 1917, which is also of technical interest (Trueman 1994), and will reveal the extent of civic investment in the system following its acquisition.

92dff504-f666-4f79-aa06-8aac22bb26a0,LARA RAZ AREA,,Hartsholme Hall Estate,"The magnificent estate at Hartsholme Hall owes its origins to an unusual combination of civic engineering and private philanthropy (Pacey 2002). The site started as a reservoir for drinking water for the city and it retained this function until 1911. The brick-fronted dam across the Prial Brook was created in 1848 and it is a relatively early surviving example of this type of structure requiring archaeological monitoring (RAZ 11.46).In 1862 a hall was built for Joseph Shuttleworth, one of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s most important industrialists, at the north end of the lake. Although a certain amount is known about this structure (Benton and Sudell 2001) it was demolished in 1951 and 1964 and our future understanding of the site will come partly from excavations. The hall was designed by F.H. Goddard and it deserves comparison with the houses of the other Lincoln industrialists, Monks Manor, Eastcliffe House (RAZ 11.28) and, especially, Boultham Hall and Bracebridge Hall (RAZ 11.9.2; 11.20), which like Hartsholme were set in open country to the south of the city. Like all these other establishments Hartsholme Hall had elaborate gardens, incorporating the water company‰Û¡ÌÝå»s lake, which partly survive as earthwork parterres and should be surveyed during the course of future management schemes. A record should also be made of the surviving planting, which will be of interest in the study of Victorian gardening as well as being an aid to future management schemes. The garden design was undertaken by E. Milner who also designed the Arboretum, and a comparison between his designs for contrasting public and private clients may yield interesting sidelights on the intentions behind the two designs. A research agenda for this topic can be extracted from Elliott 1986. Only the stable block and the mutilated South Lodge of 1879 (the last survivor of three) stands today, and this is an important survival with some architectural elaboration, which can tell us something of the management of a large country house stables in the second half of the 19th century. The estate also contained purpose-built cottages for estate workers that make valuable comparisons with other workers' housing in the city, and a boathouse built in 1881 - an unusual type of structure within the city - and two late Victorian bridges. The 1st edition O.S. shows a gasometer in the stable area and this implies that the house was powered with home-made gas. The buried remains of this domestic supply system would be of great interest and is probably of some rarity, even though there was clearly a similar system at Monks Tower on the hill east of the city (RAZ 11.28). A research agenda for gas industry sites of this type is provided in the Step 1 Report (Trueman 1997) and the Hartsholme system should be compared directly with that at Monks Tower. The hall was used as a military mess and barracks during the Second World War and there were many adaptations to the original buildings as well as wooden barrack blocks in the grounds. These adaptations are also of interest and survey work should reveal much of their layout and purpose.As mapped on the 1st edition O.S. map of 1887, the grounds of Stone‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Place were contiguous with those of Hartsholme Hall; consequently it is included within the same RAZ. The large house called Stone‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Place was located west of the lake, on the slope of a small side valley of the Prial Brook, which was almost completely filled by two large ponds created by damming the valley (RAZ 11.12). One of these ponds was used to provide power for a mill in 1887, but they also provided a well-developed landscape setting for the house, with formal gardens and parterres laid out to its south. Although not quite a residence of the scale of Hartsholme Hall, Stone‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Place provides an interesting comparison with it. It seems to have developed out of a farmhouse (at least no other farmhouse is detectable on the 1887 map) and this suggests that the building will have",Summary,"The RAZ includes the whole of the Hartsholme Hall estate as depicted on the 1st edition O.S. map along with the core of the Stone‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Place estate, which adjoins it to the north-west.

To the north the boundary runs to the south of smaller buildings and plots - along Unity Square, to the south of 18-28 and 32 Friars Lane, to the west and south of 9-25 Rosemary Lane and the former Wesleyan Day School, to the north of St. Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s burial ground, and to the west and north of the Lincoln College site on Montague Street/Monks Road. To the east the area is bounded by Montague Street (from Monks Road and Abbey Place), the northern, western and southern boundaries of 56-66 Croft Street, the western side and the rear of 9-24 Croft Street (including the car-park), Coningsby Street, and Stamp End between Coningsby Street and the Witham. The area includes St. Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street, Waterside North, Brook Street, Croft Street, Friars Lane, Rosemary Lane, the east side of Broadgate, south side of Monks Road, west side of Montague Street, south side of Coningsby Street and west side of Stamp End.St. Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s has an incoherent urban townscape, despite being close to the city centre, including large buildings of differing style and materials, smaller residential and commercial buildings, broken building lines with frequent gaps and many large unattractive open areas (e.g. surface car-parks which cover nearly a third of the Character Area). The buildings are from different periods, with some survivals from the Georgian and Victorian period, including earlier inns along Broadgate, and many larger buildings from the 1960s and 1970s, including Waterside House with distinctive facades with curved brick features.Some earlier townscape elements survive including Roman and medieval city defences (Broadgate lies on top of a filled-in defensive ditch), medieval and post-medieval street pattern including the lines of Friars Lane and Rosemary Lane, and pre-1842 field boundaries such as the boundary line of St. Swithins churchyard.The area is quite cut-off from the city centre by the high traffic volumes and barriers along Broadgate and limited crossings at surface level, and bordered on the south by the Witham. It is a very quiet area with limited permeability (partly due to larger block sizes and the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌábarriers‰Û¡ÌÝå» to west and south) and limited pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The streets, often not overlooked by people, with limited pedestrian and vehicle traffic, areas behind security railings and unkempt sites give a negative impression, and one of being unsafe for pedestrians at night.The Witham waterfront has simply a road and verge alongside the canal and is very quiet with limited active building frontages and mostly car-parks facing on to it. However, there are attractive views along the south side of the Witham including the industrial buildings, as well as views of landmark buildings situated outside the area, such as the Cathedral, Doughty‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Mill, and St. Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St. Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churches.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 48,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,58,

It is a single-span, tunnel vaulted, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáskew‰Û¡ÌÝå» bridge of brick with side arches of cut stone with keystones and is of engineering interest in its own right. A research agenda for structures of this type has been established in the Step 1 Report (OAU 1998). Future repairs and other works should be accompanied by an archaeological recording programme. At its north end stood the Toll Bar at which tolls were collected for both of the turnpikes which arrived at the city from the south. Apart from the bars on the Great North Road, this was the most lucrative toll bar in the county. Details of its structure will be preserved below ground and are of sufficient interest to merit recording programmes in association with road works. To the south of the bridge is the site of the cottage in which the toll keeper lived. This building also merits investigation, and comparison with the toll bar on Canwick Road (RAZ 11.7.2) will reveal interesting chronological differences between the earliest Toll bar systems and later ones. In 1839 the bar was moved to the south end of Swine Green, in the fork between the Newark Road and Cross O‰Û¡ÌÝå»Cliff Hill, so that a single toll booth could operate gates on both roads, whilst allowing citizens‰Û¡ÌÝå» vehicles on to the South Common without paying a toll (Hill 1974, 62).

93d88e12-b7a3-474a-a133-45c734eadb05,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Upper Witham Valley Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThis Character Area is a mosaic of open spaces including woodland, river, smaller watercourses, allotments, agricultural land, scrub and grassland. This mosaic changes in character from north to south with allotments and more urban uses to the north, wooded and grazed areas in the centre and open farmland extending into the Lincolnshire Fen to the south. This continuous green ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácorridor‰Û¡ÌÝå» brings the countryside into the City. The watercourses, including the River Witham and several associated drains, with their associated footpaths and cycleways, create linear features in the landscape. There is a range of uses in the area including walking and cycling for leisure, a transport corridor into the City, allotments, grazing and farming.The ecology of the area is also varied, with a range of habitats and species. The river and drains contain many aquatic and wetland species such as shining pondweed, common duckweed, Nuttall‰Û¡ÌÝå»s waterweed and water-plantain. There are also areas of woodland, allotments, horse-grazed land, scrub and remnants of an orchard. Views within and out of the area are very impressive, especially the views of the Cathedral and north escarpment which give a sense of approaching the City, as well as the linear views along watercourses, in particular the River Witham and views to open countryside from the southTo the south of the site few buildings are visible. There are low-lying houses on the eastern side of the river, nestled at the bottom of the south escarpment but these do not intrude upon the open character of the area. At the point where Brace Bridge crosses the river there are a number of buildings including a pub, a new housing development and several low-lying industrial units. North of Brace Bridge a few properties back on to the western bank of the river. In comparison the eastern bank is lined with houses, several of which face on to the river or have decorative features at the rear such as bay windows. The area is predominantly very tranquil but there is increasing noise further north, particularly on the approach to the road bridges. For the most part, access is good. Three bridges cross the river and there is a well-paved cycle route. Parking is available at some locations, at Boultham Park for example. There are several different types of boundary within the area. There is an initial boundary as the river bank meets the adjoining open space uses. To the south of the area these boundaries are limited to just a few hedges, adding to its open feel. Beyond these land uses are the second boundary with the edges of the built-up parts of the City. Further north these urban edges are closer to the river banks.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 106,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,101,

93e698db-3b2d-4083-8d3d-74a36633e2f0,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Sincil Street Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSincil Street Character Area is a busy commercial area and public space in the city centre, including City Square and Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s only daily markets, alongside a high proportion of independent businesses. The area is a busy thoroughfare in the city centre connecting High Street with Melville Street, Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s markets, and the Bus Station complex, including the Post Office.The area has long formed a key element of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s commercial core since the Post-Railway Expansion Period, and its current townscape illustrates changing waterside development from the High Medieval Era to the modern day. A plethora of historic features, including remnants of the former medieval riverside urban footprint, standing High-Medieval timber-framed buildings, the canalised River Witham, and the orientation of pre-1500 drainage infrastructure, combine to from a complex townscape. The River Witham, which is bridged at three points, is a strong linear feature in the Character Area around which streets are orientated both perpendicularly and parallel to the channel. The area contains a large number of landmark buildings, including the two main market buildings, the Waterside Centre and High Bridge. St. Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s spire is also a conspicuous feature to the east of the area. The Character Area is composed of large urban blocks, which extend outside of the area, integrating the area with those surrounding it. Building density is high and building scale varies, broadly decreasing away from High Street. The sense of enclosure is comparatively lower within more open spaces, wider streets, and City Square, than in areas along Waterside North and South and along Sincil Street. Pedestrian movement is often constricted through alleyways, the markets and shop premises, and over bridges. High volumes of pedestrians and the changing sense of enclosure give a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáfunnelling‰Û¡ÌÝå» and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáopening out‰Û¡ÌÝå» effect in different parts of the area. The effect is accompanied by a changing sense of vitality, with narrow and busy areas contrasting with open areas where footfall is more dispersed.Sincil Street and Waterside South, east of City Square, are made up of properties dating mainly to the Late Victorian/Edwardian or Modern Periods. Buildings are built of small-scale materials and are set at the back of the footway with active frontages facing the street. 19th-century properties include several distinct individual buildings as well as short groups of terraces, resulting in a varied pattern or narrow faÌÎå_ades within a strong building line. Modern buildings are larger or consist of more coherent groups of retail units constructed on a single development plots, producing a more coherent pattern along streets. The two market buildings are landmark buildings in the Character Area, and their prominence and individuality is emphasised by their comparably larger scale in comparison to the surrounding Late Victorian/Edwardian and Modern buildings along Sincil Street and in Cornmarket. Buildings along the River Witham date mainly to the Modern Period, with the exception two High Medieval properties in the east of the Character Area. The buildings are large, and sit in plots with their widest sides facing the river. Properties often have inactive frontages due to the interior screening of windows and several vacant premises. The Waterside Centre has a modulated faÌÎå_ade, incorporating several more traditional elements, giving a more varied appearance.The Character Area includes several ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáservice areas‰Û¡ÌÝå» with widened access and turning areas for delivery vehicles, and low solid-to-void ratios with few windows and doors looking out over the streets.Streets and pedestrianised areas are surfaced in a wide range of materials, with an unclear division between pavements and roads There is a large variety of street furniture throughout the Character Area, including some older cast-iron features and modern fixtures.The river provides a focus for some small natural features, including green borders which can be accessed of the north bank of the river, and the long line of trees running along the south bankThere are limited views from within the Character Area, the most open of which are along the river to the east and west. Good views of the north escarpment and Cathedral are visible from the Melville Street and Sincil Street.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 80,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,61,

945e57c6-cefd-4135-887c-7408b63a2ced,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Doddington Road Industrial Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌDoddington Road Industrial Character Area is located close to the bypass on the outskirts of the city and is predominantly a light industrial area that has become increasingly popular with office developments and service uses since around the turn of the twenty-first century.The area is a predominantly flat area situated to the south west of the city centre whose use has been heavily influenced by its proximity to the bypass and the availability of large plots of land. Access has been a key consideration in the development of the area and as a result there are two main roads providing access into several cul-de-sacs and larger individual units. There are also several large junctions, big enough to cater for large vehicles and heavy flows of traffic at peak times. As a result vitality in the area varies depending on the time of day but is particularly quiet at night. The area is dominated by a series of light industrial developments built mainly during the Modern Period [1968-2009 AD], although a small number of industrial units in the east of the area were constructed in the late Post-War Period [1946-1966 AD]. Industrial development has overwritten much of the former rural landscape; however, some traces of earlier activity remain evident.Buildings in the Character Area are constructed within large urban blocks on large plots, either individually or in groups of the same plan form around a courtyard or in an attached row. Buildings are often positioned in the middle of plots with parking and small areas of low-level planting and grassland filling the remainder of the plot. They vary from one to three storeys in height. The large plots and wide roads create an area that is low in density and has a low sense of enclosure. There are few active frontages as many buildings have a high solid-to-void ratio, with few doors and windows. The design of buildings varies but there is a range of scales from very large warehouses to smaller attached units. Brick is a commonly used material, though buildings often have a steel frame with a brick- and/or corrugated aluminium-clad outer shell. Decoration is limited on buildings, and is generally found in different coloured doors and window frames, and in signage. The office blocks tend to be built to a higher specification and have higher levels of decoration in terms of brick string courses, projections and greater variety of materials such as the use of glass frontages. The public/private boundary in the Character Area is predominantly fenced, including security fencing, and this is a key feature of the area. The fences are varied in many ways, including colour, style, material and condition. Despite the strongly industrial character of this area, there are several pieces of green space, including undeveloped grassland sites. Prial Drain runs along the southern boundary of the Character Area and this is a recorded wetland habitat. Trees along Doddington Road conceal the majority of the industrial estate from view.

This church requires exploration archaeologically and evidence for its layout and fittings will provide some evidence for the changing doctrinal standpoint of the church authorities here. Although the tower of this 18th-century church survives, it was comprehensively rebuilt in 1861 (architect Henry Goddard). A new chancel was added in 1878 and a new south aisle in 1884, both to designs by William Watkins. These changes can not only tell us about the expanding size of the parish, but also, in their layout and decoration, they reveal something of the developing doctrinal preoccupations of the clergy. The graveyard continued in use up until the 1850s, including the southern part, which is said to have been the location of the medieval church (RAZ 9.60.21 & 10.60.21). Burials from this graveyard will be particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered a deterioration in their circumstances. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city.

95935c9c-073b-4c2c-9fc3-4ba28d51daab,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Burton Fields Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌBurton Fields Character Area is predominantly an area of arable and improved grassland fields with associated farmsteads extending outwards from the northwestern edge of the City. The topography is mainly flat but rises to almost the full height of the escarpment in the east. This creates a progression from former wetland areas in the west, through agricultural land in the centre, to steadily inclining fields approaching the base of the escarpment where woodland fringes and scrub are more common. During the High Medieval [850-1350 AD] and Early Modern [1350-1750 AD] Eras, much of the land in the Character Area was open land held in ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon‰Û¡ÌÝå». Up until the Early Industrial Period, land immediately north of the Fossdyke probably remained as wetland and areas of meadow used for grazing, wildfowling and for the gathering of natural materials such as reeds. This may explain the more piecemeal pattern of enclosure in some parts of the area. The earliest building in the Character Area is the Pyewipe Inn, which was built in 1778.The regular pattern of rectilinear field boundaries is largely the result of enclosure of parts of the area by Act of Parliament in the early 19th century. The Lincoln West Drainage Scheme, which was carried out 1804-1816, entailed the improvement of the Main Drain and the construction of the Catchwater Drain.The major habitat is arable farmland, generally of low species diversity and rarity in comparison to the hedges, hedgerow trees and ditches that border the fields. The species are typical of those planted during the enclosure of the land in the 19th century. There are also several recent tree and shrub plantations beside the A46 and a number of waterways including the Fossdyke Navigation and two parallel drains that extend from Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Bridge to the Fossdyke. The area east of the A46 and Carholme Road consists more of a series of improved grassland fields divided by sparse and mainly unmanaged hedgerows that contain a few hedgerow trees, mostly oak, ash and birch. The strip of land nearest to the A57 used to be part of the Straight Mile of the Lincoln Racecourse. Towards the escarpment there is an area of very short sward as a result of horse grazing and a substantial amount of bare ground resulting from motorcycle scrambling. The woodland fringes to the east and south of the field, which are connected to the scrub habitat on the escarpment itself, include a varied number of species.Transport is a key feature of this Character Area and some of the roads follow the line of earlier routes that connected Lincoln to surrounding villages, such as Long Leys Road. The path of the A46, built in the 1980s, breaks up the landscape as it cuts through earlier field boundaries. The road, which sits on an embankment with several stretches of recent plantation, carries heavy traffic that produces a considerable level of noise.There are also numerous narrow lanes and trackways leading to the various farmsteads and the Pyewipe Inn. The Fossdyke canal is used by boats but is also a linear route in and out of the city for pedestrians and cyclists using the footpath on its eastern bank. The Lincoln to Sheffield railway line runs along the western bank, giving passengers a view into the Character Area.Views within the Character Area are mainly of farmland. From the lowland area there is also a good view up the north escarpment and across the uphill area of the city. The lowland part of the Character Area is one of the few places in the city where there is a clear end-on view of the west facade of the Cathedral on the Lincoln Edge and the skyline of the north escarpment. From the higher ground in the east there is a panoramic view back across the lowlands and the rural land beyond the city boundary. Within the area there are also many linear views along the watercourses. This Character Area is on the periphery of the city. In many ways its landscape has more in common with the rural, agricultural land beyond the city boundary than the city itself. However, the dominance of the road infrastructure and the strategic role it plays in getting people into and out of the city also give it an urban function. There is a close relationship between this Character Area and the escarpment as the gradual incline starts before Long Leys Road and then begins to rise more steeply beyond the St. George‰Û¡ÌÝå»s development. The Character Area is one of the main elements contributing to the rural setting of the city, as, together with West Common, it forms a continuous swathe of open space which runs right up to the edge of the city centre, bridging the divide between urban and rural.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 60,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,10,

9604e623-5e47-41f0-9c42-7b929fd2f1e2,LARA RAZ AREA,,Intermediate distance roads,"These roads connected Lincoln with smaller towns and villages in the county and probably played an important part in establishing Lincoln as a regional market centre. Only one such road led into the southern part of the city, the road to Canwick and villages beyond. This road was probably originally only defined by the tracks of vehicles which used it across South Common, although it is now marked mostly by South Park Avenue and South Park. The fact that the stretch along South Park is no longer used as a major highway probably gives an excellent opportunity to investigate its antiquity and, towards its eastern end, it is likely that some earthwork evidence for its junction with the road up the hill to Canwick will survive. This road only lies partly within the city boundary, but the deep hollow way suggests that the medieval road to Canwick and Branston was on the modern line (although the cutting was made deeper at the request of the stage-coach companies in 1846 - Hill 1948, 231, n1). Eastwards from the road junction at the foot of the hill the medieval road to Washingborough and Bardney follows the line of modern Washingborough Road, whilst to the north there is likely to have been a route leading northwards to the south end of the Stamp End causeway. This will have passed well to the east of modern Canwick Road and its southernmost parts may be detectable as earthworks in the field north of the Old Cemetery. Part of its line, however, may now be occupied by the former Lincoln-Grantham railway. As is the case with all the other roads, any information about the lines taken by the roads of this network south-east of the city will be of great help in understanding Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s links with its surrounding villages, whilst any dating evidence for changes in the road pattern will be of great importance in understanding the town as a local market centre in the early modern period. Changes in the detail of the layout of these roads will point towards the rising and falling influences of the various local settlements on the town. In this case one might ask whether the Dissolution of St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Priory had an impact on the road system to the south-east of the city as, prior to the Reformation, the priory had maintained active contacts with agricultural units in Canwick and further to the south-east. Similarly, evidence for repair and disrepair along the road towards the Stamp End causeway will be of great importance in our understanding of how this major topographical feature of the city developed and was used within the local economy.North of the city similar ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáintermediate‰Û¡ÌÝå» roads occupied the lines of Greetwell Road, Wragby Road, Nettleham Road and the road(s) to the west of the Castle. North-west of the city the roads across the Western fields can be studied through an intensive search of early air photographs as well as in ancient mapping. There seem to be four potential intermediate routes heading in this direction. The road now known as Carholme Road seems to have been a relatively important route, known as Stowgate in the 13th century; Cliffgate, coming down the scarp from the Westgate postern in the upper city, cut diagonally across the open fields to join Stowgate to the east of Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Bridge on the city boundary, before the combined road continued to Saxilby and Torksey. In addition it is highly likely that the road which linked the villages along the scarp foot north of Lincoln continued south of Burton parish and entered the city on the western side. Mr Everson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s study of the development of Burton village shows that this road originally (i.e. probably throughout the High Medieval Era) hugged the scarp foot and would probably have arrived at Willingthorpe (RAZ 9.32.1). Later this road was re-aligned to run along a similar line to the north-west/south-east stretch of Long Leys Road and may have originally entered the city along the line of the modern West Parade.

96f0f19f-9b14-4f50-9e16-c3690e9c3d6e,LARA RAZ AREA,,Swanpool Garden Suburb,"The Swanpool Garden Suburb was an important gesture in remote Lincoln to show that it was in contact with the latest ideas in philanthropic housing. A very ambitious plan was created in 1919 to develop an enormous planned suburb extending from Skellingthorpe Road northwards, almost to the Fossdyke, complete with schools and a power station (Scott 1989). The scheme for a housing association, aimed at re-housing the working class of Lincoln, was spearheaded by Colonel Ruston, one of the directors of Ruston & Hornsby. The aim was that tenants would join the Association for a very low stake and have a voice in the running of the new community. Unfortunately the scheme was beset by difficulties; there was a low take-up of shares and the construction work soon ran into serious drainage problems and building had ceased by 1925. Only a small percentage of the houses planned were actually built, and of those, some of the houses at the north end of Westwood Drive depart from the original plans. Nevertheless, the surviving houses and their layout and planting are an important group representing the early ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágarden suburb‰Û¡ÌÝå» movement in Lincolnshire. Particularly interesting are the many variants in plan found amongst the original houses, regardless of the general uniformity of the exteriors. These different plans need to be documented, as far as possible before we can start to explain why this diversity was thought to be necessary. Was there an attempt here to preserve, or even manufacture, marginal differences expressing an internal hierarchy within the working class? And, if such was the intention, who were the arbitrators of the proposed hierarchy? The planting will also have been carefully sited and chosen and species types and locations should be recorded as an aid to re-planting.",Summary,"The RAZ includes both the group of original houses and their gardens along the south part of Almond Avenue, Holme Drive, Cherry Grove, Hartsholme Drive and Westwood Close and the subsequent building in the northward extension (which followed the same original layout), along the northern parts of Almond Avenue and Hartsholme Drive, Westwood Drive and Almond Crescent.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.29.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.29.1,
9721efe3-ccc7-4fd9-8607-f3fff0303a74,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Lower Wigford (south of Great Gowt),"South of Great Gowt, Dr Vince has shown that the suburb had a quite different character - being laid out around a huge funnel-shaped market (chapter 9a -RAZ 9.20). The houses which lined the east and west sides of this market were evidently mostly confined to the northern part of the space; three additional churches developed to serve this community and eventually the decision was taken to embrace the domestic part of the market within the Sincil Dyke. To the south of the Dyke the land was clearly available for the foundation of the prestigious monastic institutions of St Sepulchre‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hospital, St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Priory (RAZ 9.54) and the Malandry Leper Hospital (RAZ 9.56). There is nothing in the foundation documentation of any of these institutions which suggests that they replaced housing in this southern part of the market area, and we can probably presume that domestic dwellings never extended this far south. The houses along the funnel-shaped High Street in the northern part of Lower Wigford should be of a similar date to the establishment of the market, probably in the 11th century, and it is important that this presumption is tested by excavation. It is also important that housing in Lower Wigford is compared with housing in Upper Wigford, north of the Gowt (RAZ 9.33). Initially, the former may not have been considered part of the city at all, but even if it was, we can speculate that the Gowt marked an important boundary within the early fabric of the city and the character of domestic buildings on the one side needs to be carefully compared with those on the other. It may be significant, for example, that only one of the known high-status houses of the 12th and 13th centuries, known to have been present in Wigford, is south of the Great Gowt, in the Parish of Holy Cross (ed Major 1973, RA2960-66, p.298-304). Equally, however, we know that there was a tannery in St Margaret‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Parish, Wigford around 1200 (ed. Major 1968, RA2464, p. 69). This tannery evidently occupied the lands between the property on the High Street and the Witham behind. The tanning process, of course, needed large supplies of water and a location such as this, on the fringe of the town (even though up-river), but next to a market place, will have been very convenient. Future work in this RAZ should bear in mind the possibility that this single documented tannery might be part of a larger industrial area. A good summary of current issues in the archaeology of the tanning industry is provided by Cherry 1991.The character of housing in Lower Wigford remains to be established, then, and compared with that in Upper Wigford.",Summary,"The northern boundary of the RAZ is marked by Great Gowt Drain whilst the east, south and west boundaries are marked by the Sincil Dyke and the Witham respectively.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.34,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.34,

Certainly the function of the general market had been re-located to the High Street south of Stonebow by the 17th century, and by 1736 the new Market House would have made such outlying markets obsolete.

976f50c1-abda-4c4d-a95c-5556ef111eef,LARA RAZ AREA,,All-Saints-in-the-Bail,"Like St Paul's across the road, All-Saints-in-the-Bail has been regarded as one of the most important of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish church sites by archaeologists and historians. No doubt this is partly because of its central location within the Bail and partly because the church is called a 'monasterium' in 1169-76 (Hill 1948, 116). It is possible that this church owes its origin to the presumed early Christian site at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, which is not more than 100m to the west. Both churches could, for example, have played different liturgical roles within a familia of churches at the heart of a 10th-century (or earlier) monastery. There is little documentary support for this idea, however, although it remains possible, and exploration of the idea should be included within all subsequent research agendas. It is equally possible, however, that All Saints owes its origins to St Mary of Lincoln, which lay a little further to the south and (on the grounds that the original churchyard of St Mary is likely to have extended to the former east-west Roman road north of All Saints) it is presumed that it originally lay within the cemetery of this Minster church (RAZ 9.62). Perhaps all three churches, St Mary, St Paul and All Saints once provided liturgical stations within the single enclosure provided by the upper city wall. In such circumstances the upper city could be viewed, not as a secular or an urban holding in the 9th -11th centuries, but more as a monastic community (similar to the, much smaller, Roman enclosure at Utrecht, for example). There are arguments against this view of the upper city in the 9th-11th centuries as a monastery and Stocker (forthcoming a) prefers to see the Bail churches as adjuncts of aristocratic estate centres, of which there may have been several. This possibility must also be explored, and All Saints is likely to be the most convenient place to do it.Little is known about the development of the church in the 13th century, but the parish was united with St Mary Magdalene as early as 1318 and the Dean and Chapter were given authority to dispose of it (Jones et al. 1990, 51). This early closure offers an important archaeological opportunity to study a parish church at the height of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s prosperity and before the long sequence of repair and modification brought about by the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economic decline became established. Any contrasts which can be drawn between the churches of the upper city and those of the lower city will also be of great value. There can be little doubt that the economic basis of the upper city was different from that of the lower city, and that may have an effect on periods of church embellishment, but it is also possible that the proximity of the Cathedral influenced the detail of liturgical practices, and these might also be detected archaeologically.",Summary,"The site of the churchyard is known in general terms but none of its boundaries has been precisely located. The church was in existence before the establishment of the modern line of Eastgate (argued above to have been laid out after 1068 (RAZ 9.47, RAZ 9.24). After the layout of Eastgate, shortly after 1068, the new street must have formed its southern boundary, but previously the churchyard may have extended yet further south. At an early date, also, the churchyard may have occupied a site south of a road leading from the Roman east gate to the Roman west gate. To the east it may have been bounded by a lane on the line of the modern James Street, whilst to the west it seems to have extended, originally, all the way to the line of modern Bailgate - as the Angel Inn was built within the churchyard in the mid 12th century (Jones et al. 1996, 144). The RAZ is drawn to include a large plot with the hope of including not just the whole original churchyard, but also the adjacent route ways so that their interrelationships can be studied.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.30,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.30,

98698ca2-9ae6-4219-939c-2f85482d2145,LARA RAZ AREA,,Riparian deposits,"As in previous (and subsequent) periods, a large area of the valley floor contains waterlogged deposits that were originally laid down by the Rivers Witham and Till. These are important deposits for the understanding the development of valley through time, and a start has been made by systematic analysis of bore holes south of the modern Brayford. The aim of such work is not merely to define the edges of the wetlands at various periods, but also the analysis of plant macro- and micro-fossils of pollen and of molluscs and insects. Work on these deposits will reveal important information about such matters as the relative strength of flow of water in the main channel (which will be crucial in understanding any changes in river management in the 4th century) and the likelihood, or otherwise, that the Fossdyke was constructed in the Roman period. On the evidence available to us at present, there is little but tradition to point to an origin for the Fossdyke in the Roman period. The topographical development of the Roman city seems to suggest that there was no exit to the west from Brayford Pool, apart from along the rivers Witham and Till. The distribution of later Roman pottery suggests that imports from the Trent Valley were rare and, conversely, Swanpool products did not travel to the west. Had there been a canal connecting the Witham with the Trent we would have expected a much more even distribution of the Swanpool products in the East Midlands to the west of the city (Darling and Precious, forthcoming). These riparian deposits also contain a most important assemblage of finds. Although such finds are frequently seen in isolation, and interpreted as casual losses, in earlier and later eras these finds are now clearly identified as votive deposits, made to the spirits of the river and pools (Stocker and Everson 2003). So far only a few of these finds have been of Roman date, but the peat is likely to contain further finds from the Roman Colonia Era - and their character and the pattern of their deposition will tell us a great deal about the character of ritual practise at the pool during the Roman Era. It is suggested below (RAZ 7.20 and 7.21) that the Romans' interest in the sacred pool was focused on their temple complex along its northern shore and this might mean that the relative rarity of Roman finds indicating votive deposits in the pool itself represents a real rarity. In the Roman Era, perhaps, such deposits were made within the formal temple complex itself. The potentially sacred nature of the pool also means that we should be particularly interested in any occupation on islands within it (RAZ 7.21.1, 7.21.2). Although such islands are dealt with under a different RAZ it is conceivable that offerings were made into the water around the islands and so the shores of the known islands should be searched especially carefully for evidence of votive offerings.",Summary,The boundaries of the RAZ are drawn to include all the land below the 5m contour.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.9,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.9,

98796791-9ac9-4874-b8e4-7b4ca5c07311,LARA RAZ AREA,,Public Parks and Gardens,"The earliest area set aside for common recreation seems to have been Besom Park (now The Park) - a raised landscaped walk along the line of the former western defences of the city, using the ruins of the wall and bank itself as the basis for the walkway (ed. Jones 1999, 3). This looks like an interesting example of a rather impoverished version of the more elaborate 18th-century walkway gardens found in some other cities and both its date and original character require further research (Conway 1991). A second early piece of landscaping for the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» benefit probably occurred at the ruins of Monks' Abbey where two slight walls set within an ornamental ditch are probably the remains of an ornamental cascade built here in the 18th century (Stocker 1984, 103). This cascade seems similar in concept to the water-course which flowed through the Temple Gardens in the early 19th century (see below) and early views of the masonry ruins strongly suggest that it had been tidied up to look appropriately picturesque. It is possible that the water source, probably a spring known to be located somewhere to the north-west of the ruins, would have been housed in a building of some sort. This feature may show on geophysical surveys, but will now be located north of Monks Road. This implies that we have here an interesting suburban example of the creation of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáromantic‰Û¡ÌÝå» gardens around ruins, especially monastic ruins, which reached a climax in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Evidence for this phase of use of the site, as a public resort, should be sought in future work on the site in the fabric (RAZ 9.55.1; 10.55) as well as in the ground, and the site should be compared, not just with Temple Gardens, but also with more famous urban abbey sites such as St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey York (Stocker 1979) or Reading Abbey. A research agenda for this aspect of Monks' Abbey can be derived from Conway 1991. The so called ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáTemple Gardens‰Û¡ÌÝå» began life before 1834 as a fee-paying pleasure-garden, owned by a local solicitor, Joseph Moore, and intended for the relaxation of the middle classes (Land Use Consultants 1998). In 1863, however, this facility closed and it became the private garden of Mr Collingham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s new house on Lindum Road (Hill 1974, 13). As a Victorian pleasure park the Temple Gardens are of considerable interest and a research agenda can be extracted from Conway 1991. Little seems to be known about the layout adopted, but the remains of paths and garden buildings will survive below ground, as may some of the antiquities with which the garden was fashionably decorated. Structures installed for temporary galas, exhibitions and concerts may also survive as buried features. The single surviving structure (the Temple itself modelled on the Choragic Monument of Thrasyllus with sculptures dated 1830) is a rare building in its own right and is of particular interest because it housed equipment serving the water cascade, which seems to have represented complex engineering. Remains of this water control system will be of considerable technical interest. The gardens were laid out with elaborate planting some of which may have survived on the site, and it is important that a survey of the modern planting is undertaken to identify any survivors, both so that we can understand the original planting scheme better and for consideration when making replacements. The RAZ element includes the eastern part of the gardens, which originally extended as far east as Greestone Stairs, but which was taken over by the Girls High School (RAZ 11.58) in 1898.It is likely that the disappearance of the Temple Gardens in 1863 stimulated public demand for the Arboretum (Monks Road), a larger version of the pleasure ground, only this time managed by the increasingly public-minded City Council.

99383bf0-4681-4dcd-8c57-52c22b039b4a,LARA RAZ AREA,,Stone and clay quarries in the cliff face east of the city,"As is the case with the quarries to the north-west of the city, any residual common rights to dig clay and stone to the east of the city will have been extinguished with enclosure in 1803, although the extent of common rights in this part of the city (on the former Monks‰Û¡ÌÝå» Abbey estate) had always been problematic (RAZ 9.8.5, 10.8.5). It is not known when the Council-owned clay pits and brick works in the close to the west of what is now Milman Road closed (RAZ 10.41.2), but it does not occur on 19th-century mapping. Further work on sites in this vicinity should investigate its date of closure and, in so far as possible, its causes. Similarly, by the mid-Victorian period, the great belt of medieval and earlier building stone quarries between Wragby Road and Lindum Terrace was occupying land now valuable for housing, and it is likely that quarrying (at least surface quarrying for building stone), along with the burning of lime in Limefield, had ceased here by the mid-19th century. The limekilns were certainly out of use by 1889 (1st edition OS map). Its departure from the Limefield may have been indicated, or facilitated, by the transfer of Cathedral stone-working and lime production to their new quarry on Riseholme Road in about 1839 (RAZ 11.41.5). The quarry in the Limefield is marked as 'Nelthorpe‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Quarry' on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1842, suggesting that the Cathedral had already leased the land out to a private operator by that date.Although there is little evidence for intense quarrying for building stone within this part of the RAZ in the late 18th and early 19th century, there are important remains of new pillar-and-stall mining for ironstone based in the ancient quarries. These workings seem surprisingly poorly documented, and it is not clear who instigated them, or when. Since most (if not all) of the quarry pits between Wragby Road and Lindum Terrace belonged to the Dean and Chapter, however, they may have been the sponsors. It has long been known that there was an extensive series of tunnels and ventilation shafts under the whole Eastgate suburb, but it is only recently that any sort of archaeological study of these remains has been made (Jefferson 2002). This report arose out of the discovery of a well-constructed mine shaft on the quarry terrace, or floor, on which the Adam and Eve pub sits, just to the south-east of Pottergate Arch. The shaft is thought to be 19th-century in date and it was clearly aimed at winning the band of ironstone, which lies immediately below the base of the building stone. Although it was not explored for any great length, a well-constructed gallery headed north-west from the foot of the shaft and presumably links up with the isolated lengths of shafts and galleries reported from all over the Eastgate suburb. It seems likely, then, that at least some of the pillar-and-stall mining underneath the Eastgate suburb was aimed at winning, not building stone, but ironstone, and that it is 19th-century in date. As neither the Adam and Eve mine (nor any others) are recorded on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map, or on the 1st edition OS (1889), working had presumably ceased by the 1840s, but it is unlikely to have begun much before the mid-18th century, and Mr Jefferson believes that the shaft incorporates fittings for a steam engine, which means that it is unlikely to have been sunk prior to c.1800. These remains are an important element of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s early industrial history, showing that it was intended to exploit the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s natural resources in the services of the new industries. In the 1870s, Joseph Ruston tried to start an iron quarrying and smelting industry in Lincoln to serve the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s booming manufactories (Hill 1974, 201). The remains under the Eastgate suburb may suggest that Ruston‰Û¡ÌÝå»s was not an original idea. These extensive workings are of considerable importance and should be explored in detail and mapped at the earliest opportunity, and the above-ground structures servicing the mines (which were pres",Summary,"The RAZ boundary includes the whole of the area of RAZ 10.41.2, but with extensions in several directions to include the remains of the more extensive quarrying and mining of the 19th century. To the north-east the RAZ includes the whole of the suburb of Eastgate as far west as the line of the Roman city wall. This is to include the area of pillar-and-stall ironstone mining known to exist underneath. The most easterly shaft of the underground system so far reported lies immediately to the north of the Chapter House. It is not known whether the system extended north of Eastgate itself but shafts have been reported in the St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane area. Until evidence for mining further north is forthcoming, therefore, the boundary follows the northern side of modern Eastgate and Langworthgate. The northern boundary then follows the south side of Wragby Road to the city boundary. This is to include the whole area mapped as mined in figure 11 of Brown‰Û¡ÌÝå»s brief study (1971). It is not known whether the area between Curle Avenue and Greetwell Close was mined in this way, but given the extent of pillar-and-stall mining to both the east and the west, this remains a possibility and it is included in the RAZ. The RAZ boundary then follows the District boundary southwards from the Wragby Road to include the extensive mining remains around Greetwell Hollow and it extends southwards as far as the former LNER line, to include the large works yard servicing the mines, with the sites of their processing equipment. The south boundary of the RAZ is drawn further to the north than that of RAZ 10.41.2, as we have no evidence for stone or clay mining beneath the foot of the cliff during the Industrial Era - indeed the western parts of the open land east of the city wall were taken for housing during the second half of the 19th century. Therefore the RAZ boundary line follows the foot of the cliff from the LNER junction with the spur line to the quarry as far west as the city wall near the foot of modern Lindum Road.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.41.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.41.2,

994200ee-0ad8-4c2a-9e28-8056618c6aa2,LARA RAZ AREA,,Enclosed pasture and meadow east and west of the city,"The extensive common pastures of the Early Modern Era (RAZs 10.8.1, 10.8.2, 10.8.5) had been under pressure from piecemeal enclosure, and the position was formalised in the Enclosure Act of 1803. By this Act many of the remaining common rights of citizens in the enclosed closes were removed and transferred to the newly defined West and South Commons. The enclosed closes east and west of the West Common became private closes for the 50-80 years before they were sold for building land. The commoners' rights in the Monks Leys, east of the city, seem to have survived until these lands were required for housing towards the end of the 19th century, when they were swapped with the City Council for outright ownership of the Arboretum (RAZ 11.76). In the west, at least some of the closes to the west of the new West Common were presumably managed from Waves Farm, some of whose dispersed buildings are shown on the 1st edition O.S. map. These lands were not included in the 1803 Enclosure Act, however, suggesting that private enclosure had already taken place in these areas west of the Common. Presuming it was established during the late 18th century, however, the original layout of some, if not all, of these Waves Farm yards may represent a model of agricultural thinking in the enclosure period. Other closes in this western part of the city, however, were probably managed from Lowfield Farm. The original plans of all these installations should be recovered and compared with model farms elsewhere in the county and country (RAZ 11.12; 11.13; 11.15.2; 11.17; Barnwell & Giles 1997). The present buildings on these sites should be recorded during the course of any alterations with the aim of understanding the changes in a substantial ‰Û¡ÌÝÌánew‰Û¡ÌÝå» farm of the 19th century.The extent to which these changes made at Enclosure were as oppressive can be exaggerated. By the end of the 19th century at any rate, few commoners had numbers of animals that they wished to graze. They would have found railways and housing more helpful items of civic infrastructure. It would be helpful if an impact of the 1803 Act could be identified archaeologically.

Although, unlike in Butwerk, there is no evidence for a wall in Newland, one might be presumed, especially as, like Butwerk, there is a gate here. A section should be cut across the line of the presumed wall and ditch to ascertain its date and character. As before, as a rare type of monument, the gate on Carholme Road will be of great interest and should be investigated during the course of services work in the modern road. It is speculated (for want of solid information) that the northern part of this boundary ran along the west side of the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s garden (RAZ 9.32.2). This part of the ditch may be that mentioned by Edward Willson as running up the slope towards the so-called 'Giant's Grave' in the early 19th century (London.

9a3a531c-59c1-48c2-9a49-ec8f98ad2965,LARA RAZ AREA,,Carmelite Friary,"The four friaries of the major orders (Augustinian, Carmelite, Dominican and Franciscan) in Lincoln represent a good group by national standards, and in addition, Lincoln has a relatively rare example of a Friary of the Sack. The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In all four, of course, the churches and other claustral buildings will be of interest and plans need to be recovered, but we know a great deal about fraternal plans (e.g. Butler 1984) and attention should now be turning to more complex aspects of the archaeology of friaries. One of the new avenues requiring exploration is the study of burial populations at friaries; cemeteries will be of interest as valuable resources for paleo-pathology, but although we have a certain level of documentation about burials in the Lincoln friaries, we badly need a fully excavated graveyard to provide a proper sample. Some burials have been excavated under the Carmelite Friary, but it is not clear what percentage of the total they represent. These types of studies may be best targeted at the Austin Friary in Newport, which seems to be almost completely undisturbed. Consequently, any development proposals here should be accompanied by provision for the archaeological excavation of the complete church and burial ground. A similar opportunity may also exist at the Blackfriars, although the many reports of burials found here over the years suggest that this burial population may have been compromised already.The Lincoln Carmelite Friary, or Whitefriary, was, like the Blackfriars and Greyfriars, an important house within the order. Even so the documentary history of the institution is scanty. The site has been the subject of two major excavations (Z86, ZEA95, Wragg 1995a), but the results have yet to be published. They show, nevertheless, that this was a complex group of buildings around a cloister to the north of the church, with many unusual components in the plan. The Kyme chapel, however, the one structure whose appearance can be partially reconstructed from architectural fragments reused in St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Conduit (Stocker 1990), has yet to be located. Now that the conventual buildings have been planned, further work on the site should concentrate on some of the more problematic archaeology within the site. First, as a partially waterlogged precinct, attention should be paid to the western part of the site, where important artefactual and environmental evidence for the life of the friary is likely to be preserved. Secondly, this site also offers an excellent opportunity (not taken in the previous excavations) to investigate the way in which the friars dealt with their commercial street front along High Street. We need to understand whether they sought to capitalise on this valuable land as a regular monastery would have done, or whether, in line with their vows, they took no part in the commerce of Wigford to the east of their boundary wall. In this context the letting to a secular of a chamber within the precinct near Le Garners in 1520 is of particular interest (ed. Page 1906, 225). As with the other three friaries, there is considerable interest in the type of site that they were given in 1269. In Wigford, the residence of the elite at this date, we might expect a grand house set within its own spacious plot extending from the High Street to the Witham. If so, archaeology may provide some hints as to why such an apparently desirable plot was given to the Carmelites. Whilst the other three friaries are to some extent sited on marginal land, or land which was constrained in various ways, the Carmelites (perhaps the latest of the foundations - as the Augustinians were already present in Newport in 1270) seem to have been given a plum site and it is worth investigating why this should be.",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the whole precinct of the friary at its fullest extent, the site of which has been deduced from documents (Gilmour and Stocker 1986, fig 3).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.53.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.53.3,

9a66e8ad-4009-400c-aab1-4c1764f1d075,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Lindum Hill Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌLindum Hill Character Area is situated on the steepest part of the north escarpment on the eastern side of the city centre and contains properties that are used for a mixture of residential, civic and service functions. Lindum Road, a busy inner-city bypass, forms much of the eastern boundary of the area and defines the transition between the city centre to the west and more residential areas to the east. The mixture of uses as well as the road‰Û¡ÌÝå»s role as the north/south inner-city bypass lead to high volumes of traffic and pedestrian footfall, giving the area a strong sense of vitality. Alongside many features surviving from Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Roman and Medieval history, including the routes of Flaxengate, Danesgate, Danes Terrace, Grantham Street and Pottergate, the townscape of the area includes many elements associated with the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s growth during the Early Industrial Period when Lindum Road quickly became a focus for development.Urban blocks are divided into varying sizes of building plots, from the more organised rectangular plots of residential properties off Lindum Road, to the larger and irregularly-shaped plots of large-scale buildings such as the Usher Gallery and the Lincoln College building. Buildings within the Character Area consist of a number of individual large-scale detached buildings such as The Collection and the Usher Gallery, as well a few small groups of properties of lesser scale facing Lindum Road. The majority of properties have active frontages, with doors and windows facing the street, creating a sense of activity and security along streets. Buildings towards the upper parts of the slope are plain and symmetrical in style, with a few loosely classical decorative features. Properties along the lower parts of the slope are comparatively more ornate, and individual in style.Tall walls, many of which are retaining walls built into the slope, are a repetitive feature of the Character Area. The low stone boundary wall along the south-eastern side of Lindum Hill acts a retaining wall for the road, but also permits long-distance views over the rooftops of houses to rural areas along the south escarpment and within the lower Witham valley. The tall boundary walls lead to a sense of inactivity and enclosure in many parts, emphasising the role of the road as a bypass around the city centre to the west. Elsewhere there are complex uphill views of buildings forming a broken building line up Lindum Road, as well as views of the Cathedral towers and the complex of buildings around the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace.A large proportion of the Character Area consists of open space, the majority of which is within the public Temple Gardens. Remaining open space in the area consists of mature garden plots to the rear of houses in the northern half of the area. The public realm along Danesgate, Flaxengate and Grantham Street underwent major works which were concluded in 2008.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 70,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,39,

9ab3d702-37a1-4a9c-b428-7a9d5ebb5be8,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Giles,"Like St Bartholomew (RAZ 10.60.3) and Holy Innocents (10.60.17), by the late Middle Ages the parish church of St Giles had become entirely subsumed within the hospital which had been imposed on it (RAZ 10.58). Although Hill said that there was no evidence for any parochial responsibilities in the late Middle Ages (1948, 147), an indulgence was offered in 1453 to those who gave alms and ornaments to the 'parish church' (1948, 286). The parish does not figure in the 1428 subsidy collectors‰Û¡ÌÝå» accounts and it is possible that the only residents of the parish were inmates of the hospital and that, although it retained the title, the church had effectively ceased to be parochial on the hospital‰Û¡ÌÝå»s foundation. Consequently, the research agenda for the parish church in the Early Modern Era is identical with that for the hospital and chapel (RAZ 10.58).",Summary,"It is presumed that the parish church became the chapel of the hospital, in which case it seems likely that its ruins were those of the hospital chapel, on the south side of the hospital precinct, alongside Wragby Road. However, this has not been located precisely east to west and we have no evidence at all for the other three churchyard boundaries. Consequently it has been decided not to draw a separate RAZ for the parish church but to use the same boundary for both church and hospital RAZs.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.7,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.7,

9b215fae-df79-48ee-88a0-57376a85c515,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Milman Road to Frederick Street Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe area is bounded by Monks Road to the south and Milman Road to the west. The eastern boundary is formed by the rear of the properties on the east side of Frederick Street. The northern boundary is the footpath just to the north of all the streets between Milman Road and Frederick Street. The area includes all the streets between Milman Road and Frederick Street, and the north side of Monks Road between these two streets.This Character Area has a quiet residential townscape with a coherent grid-iron street pattern of two/three-storey single-fronted terraced houses from the Edwardian period. There is a broad homogeneity of architectural form and style. However, within the wider style there is a variety of detail (e.g. brick eaves mouldings) and a variety of form (e.g. some houses with joint entrances off central passageways with window above). There are also some slightly larger and more ornate buildings facing out of the area onto Monks Road and on Milman Road. Materials are mainly red Albion brick and Welsh slate roofs, although there are many modern replacement doors, windows and rainwater goods that do not have the same details or scale as the original features, and some re-rendered/re-clad building facades.The steep slope up from Monks Road is an important characteristic which creates a rising vertical rhythm of repeated building details along the streets, e.g. chimneys in the roofscape. It also provides good views of the south escarpment.The area has good connections to the south on to Monks Road, and to the west along Monks Road and along the footpath heading to and from the Arboretum.

9b4dbc41-84e3-4e74-b64a-d1e7c5b49364,LARA RAZ AREA,,Buildings on the sand islands in the Brayford,"Mr Jones comments (chapter 6a) on the importance of the structures on the sand island in the middle of the pool (HG72). Here an early Roman structure replaced an Iron Age building close to the line of the causeway. It is suggested in Chapter 5a that the Iron Age building is likely to have played some role in the ritual use of the pools. Consequently the character of the early Roman replacement building, whether ritual or secular, will elucidate the potential ritual significance of the pools, and the symbolic significance of the causeway superimposed on them. It is likely that further information about this building, or any other buildings on the sand islands linked by the causeway, will be of very great value in helping to understand whether the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáRomanisation‰Û¡ÌÝå» of the Iron Age ritual site was instant or gradual. Stray finds from these areas should also be viewed with these issues in mind.A second occupied island may have existed in the wetlands (RAZ 6.7), which was known in the Middle Ages as Hartsholme. Because this island was the site of an interesting and apparently early religious foundation in the Medieval period (RAZ 9.61), there is a possibility that this island of dry land within the marsh might have played some role in ritualistic uses of the pool at earlier dates. It might be comparable, therefore, with the island discovered at HG73. The island first needs defining and then investigating to see if the sequence of ritual uses extends back into the Roman Military Era.",Summary,"The boundaries of this RAZ are all poorly defined at present. The sand island has only been located through analysis of borehole data in one section and further analysis is required (Vince and Steane 2000, 306). The western boundary can be defined quite accurately using data from DM72 and BWE82. There is some information regarding its northern and southern boundaries, which lay south of St Benedict‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Square and north of the St Mark's site respectively. The eastern extent of the island in the Military Era might have lain somewhere beneath the station. NB, further islands may remain to be discovered within the early pool, and some of these might have been utilised by the early causeway.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.3,

9bbff8ed-7b12-4871-8e06-8747bd7964d2,LARA RAZ AREA,,Close Wall,"The security of clergy moving from their homes within the Close to the Cathedral at night had become an increasing concern since the city wall had been removed to allow the Angel Choir to be built in 1256 (Hill 1948, 120-1; Major 1974, 25-8). At the petition of Bishop Sutton, in 1285 Edward I granted the Chapter licence to erect a wall 12 feet high and to enclose within it the King‰Û¡ÌÝå»s road of Pottergate and the road from Bailgate to the gate of Eastgate, plus two lanes (James Street and one now vanished) near the road to the north of the gate. Lockable gates were to be provided along this new Close wall, and an appointed person was to close them at dusk and open them before sunrise. The grant was confirmed in 1315, and in 1316 the Chapter was permitted to enclose a lane - thought to be St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane - leading southwards from the churchyard of St Peter Eastgate towards Pottergate, and to crenellate the wall. In 1318 the Chapter was allowed to raise the height of the wall from 12 feet, to build turrets (towers) and to crenellate the raised wall. By c.1327 the wall was nearing completion, and the Chapter was allowed to adopt the Bail wall as Close wall along the south side of the Cathedral to complete the circuit (see Jones et al. 1984: fig. 2). Today the wall survives to varying heights for most of its circuit (ed. Gibbs 2001, 95-7), although the sections between the north-east corner of the Cloister and Priorygate Arch and between the east end of Winnowsty Lane and Pottergate have been removed. Particularly well preserved is the stretch from the Priorygate Arch to the east end of Winnowsty Lane, where wall-walk and towers survive including one constructed to incorporate the north section of the pre-existing house at No.2 Minster Yard (a fine painted dresser from alterations of this period also survives elsewhere in the property). Although this building has been the subject of an authoritative study (Jones et al. 1984, 23-32), the fact that it was completely reconstructed at a known medieval date makes the detailed evidence of its fabric of particular importance. All future works here must be the subject of detailed recording. The wall fabric itself (and the buried remains of missing sections) will preserve important information, relatively undisturbed in the eastern parts of the circuit, for the original sequence of construction and thus the state of defensive thinking for urban enclosures in the first half of the 14th century. In the northern part of the circuit, however, the complex sequence of reconstructions will need to be understood (though detailed fabric recording) before these issues can be addressed. The wall includes a number of unusual details, for example in the form and locations of its cross-loops and in the siting, access and function of its mural towers, and, when studied, these will cast light on the extent to which the clergy intended the wall to be seen as a serious defence. Or was it, alternatively, largely a structure advertising status? Furthermore we know that the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s defences were enhanced during the Civil War and it is possible that the wall fabric retains rare evidence for repair and rehabilitation of this date. All works to the wall must be accompanied by detailed programmes of recording. Of the gatehouses, only two survive - the inner gatehouses of Exchequergate and the southern gatehouse on Pottergate. The former has been the subject of an authoritative study by Stanley Jones (1987, 91-101), who shows that this was originally a large complex with two great gate houses east and west separated from each other by commercial and administrative buildings on the south side and by the church of St Mary Magdalene on the north. The western Exchequergate was demolished in 1796 but important remains will survive in excellent condition beneath the pavement and should be investigated when road works permit. The surviving eastern Exchequergate gatehouse represents a unique survival in Britain of a gate",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn to include the entire circuit of the walls along with the footprint of the gatehouses. It includes a strip about 10m wide on either side of the thickness of the wall itself, in order to include the buried archaeological relationships between the wall footings and the structures below, which it superseded.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.50.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.50.2,

It crossed Sincil Dyke between Melville Street and Pelham Street carrying the main road from Magpies Bridge on the north towards the Durham Ox crossing and Canwick Road to the south. It had a single span flattened arch. A research agenda for structures of this type has recently been established in the Step 1 Report (OAU 1998).,Summary,The RAZ includes the bridge depicted on the 1st edition OS map and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.7.4,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.7.4,

9c0cbcd9-b947-4354-b39b-fcb91bc8f279,LARA RAZ AREA,,Bracebridge pastures,"The village of Bracebridge was enclosed piecemeal - by private treaties, apparently before 1762 (Cameron 1985, 192-4), and the areas of former common pasture by the river (RAZ 10.8.3) became fields associated with farms based on the cliff above outside the city boundary. The field ditches and hedges are likely to have been established at this time. The fields themselves will preserve some evidence of drainage techniques as they were at the start of the 19th century. The meadows on the west side of the Witham, which lay in mostly in North Hykeham parish, were centred around Manor Farm. Many buildings of this complex still survive and should be the subject of recording during repair and alteration. The original layout of this farm and its buildings should be compared with model farms of the early 19th century and with other farms in Boultham (RAZ 11.12 & 11.13) and the city (see RAZ 11.17). As a group these farms need to be compared with the ideal 19th-century farms, explored both in Lincolnshire and in the country more widely by Barnwell & Giles (1997).",Summary,"The south and east boundaries of the RAZ are marked by the city boundaries.

9c97a882-2050-421b-9a0c-008d314230f0,LARA RAZ AREA,,Bracebridge,"Dr Vince has given a brief assessment of the village of Bracebridge, based on the few scanty medieval documents and the Domesday entry (chapter 9a). The location of the two manors which made up the vill can be guessed at - the first was probably around the church and the second around the 19th-century Bracebridge Hall (RAZ 11.19.2). Even so, these possible locations need to be tested as soon as practical, because without a basic understanding of the topography of the vill, proper archaeological provision will be difficult. As the caputs of two documented manors, both centres will be important for the study of rural settlement in the county. A research agenda for this topic is currently in production as part of the East Midlands Research Agenda process (Everson 2000; Courtney 2001), but settlement in the area has been characterised by Roberts and Wrathmell (2000) and their characterisation raises most of the key questions. Many tofts have been excavated in Lincolnshire and in the East Midlands more widely (see links in Everson 2000), but nevertheless, further information is almost always valuable. In the case of Bracebridge, exploration of the tofts should focus on particular characteristics which might be distinctive here, on account of the settlement‰Û¡ÌÝå»s proximity to the city. Over and above general considerations, the vill of Bracebridge should be of particular interest because of this proximity to the city and to the major crossing point over the Witham on the route from the city to the south-west. We should ask whether the rural economy of such vills was affected by their proximity to the city. Mills seem to be prominent in the vill‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economy, for example, and we might ask whether a surplus was being produced here for supplying the city market. Such a surplus of flour would imply a relatively large area in the vill's fields down to wheat, barley and rye each year and it would be worth researching whether the use of the heath-land on the cliff outside the city boundary was turned to the plough for this reason. These heath-lands were more normally used elsewhere as sheep-walks in the medieval period. Similarly the well-documented fisheries here may have been much larger than was needed for the vill‰Û¡ÌÝå»s own purposes and we might ask if they were also supplying the city market. The vill might have been supplying other more specialist products to the city as well - in the early 16th century there is a reference to a hempstall at Bracebridge - a place where hemp was grown, presumably for rope-making for city chandlers (Cameron 1985, 194). There is also a reference in 1240 to an area known as 'suthbrakene', which Professor Cameron (1985, 194) explains represents a place where bracken grew. Bracken is unlikely to have been a weed and is more likely to represent an important source of potash for the dyeing industry in the city (bracken was used as a major source of potash in the medieval period (Rackham 1986, 295) and potash was an essential ingredient in most cloth dyes - Campbell 1971, 24). Any remains of this industrial activity (clamps and associated structures) will be of the greatest interest and will fill in a gap in our knowledge of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s medieval cloth industry.The RAZ includes the site and fabric of All Saints Church Bracebridge, a major parish church retaining important 11th-century fabric and an intact burial ground. The church fabric itself has been the subject of much discussion (Taylor and Taylor 1965, 85-6; Stocker and Everson forthcoming) and from these descriptions detailed research agendas should be produced to inform archaeological recording projects. Such projects must be undertaken whenever the fabric is scaffolded for repair. This is one of the most important church fabrics in the county and no opportunity should be lost to understand it further. In the present context, we should be interested in the way in which the church fabric mirrors the foundation, growth and decline of the settlemen",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the known, or estimated area of tofts and crofts and the sites of the two known manorial curiae. The RAZ is also intended to include the length of river bank to the west of the settlement where it is known that there were at least two water mills with their associated water courses, and a number of fisheries. These structures will be of great interest in themselves and are likely to be well preserved, potentially in water-logged conditions, making them particularly important.

9d7044b5-c223-4040-88d5-21f35cb1fe58,LARA RAZ AREA,,Newly-built Victorian housing for the middle and upper classes c. 1850-1918,"It was no doubt because of the existing concentration of the educated elite in the Close, as well as the dominant view over the city and its new industrial plant, perhaps, that the area between the cliff edge and Newport became the principal area for the homes of both the factory owners and the professionals and senior managers who acted as their deputies (recently studied in Hill 2001). Many of these houses were large isolated villas standing in substantial, planted, grounds but much the grandest amongst the houses were those of the founders of the two largest engineering industries. Nathaniel Clayton built Eastcliffe House between Sewell Road and Lindum Terrace in 1877 and Joseph Ruston built the even larger Monks Manor on land between Greetwell Road and Wragby Road in 1870. Both buildings deserve comparison with country houses of the period (Girouard 1979), rather than with urban architecture, and their only comparisons within the city boundaries can be with Bracebridge Hall, Hartsholme Hall and Boultham Hall (RAZ 11.19.2, 11.20, 11.34). Both Monks Manor and Eastcliffe House have been demolished (in 1932 and 1926 respectively), but there will be substantial surviving remains below ground, which will be of considerable interest in reconstructing how the industrial elite of Victorian Lincoln lived. There were, in addition, many other interesting buildings in this large and spacious enclave, all of which are recorded on early O.S. mapping and which should be investigated as opportunity allows. Amongst these, Coldbath House must have been particularly dramatic as it was perched on the cliff edge and incorporated the old well and spring (the 'Wainwell') in its grounds. It was built by H.K. Hebb, a Town Clerk and chairman of the Lincoln and Lindsey Bank in the 1860s-90s and had a room designed to entertain the entire Council (Hill 1974, 171). Similarly The Mount, The Quarry and Stonefield House are large, architect-designed dwellings and the surviving Leyland House (The Grove) was designed for himself by William Watkins in 1875. Stonefield House may have been more integrated into the surrounding rural economy as the 1889 O.S. map depicts it with a dairy and a kennels (Herridge 1999, No.5258). Another surviving example of the largest detached type of villa is Lindum House on Sewell Road, although there is an important group of large semi-detached villas at Nos. 1-7 Lindum Terrace. To the south of the Close a line of grand terraced houses was constructed along the north side of the New Road (now Lindum Road) when it was built in 1786. These must be amongst the earliest high-quality terraced houses in Lincoln (a housing type which was never common here) and, although relatively late in date, should be compared with speculative development along the newly-laid out roads leading out of other cities such as London and Nottingham. There are more large and important late Victorian houses at the south end of Lindum Road (Nos. 1-7) and of these No.7, which belonged to the Collingham family, is particularly important because it took over the elaborate ornamental Temple Gardens, including buildings and sculpture elements. Some of these garden features survive in the area of landscaping east of the Usher Gallery. This is another important Victorian garden that should be recorded in detail and reconstructed on paper. It is now one of the best surviving examples of its type in Lincoln (RAZ 11.76). A small group of middle-class houses was built along Drury Lane and the upper part of Spring Hill with West Hill House facing south over the valley. This group was not quite continuous with a small enclave of large but terraced houses north and east of Beaumont Manor - itself a fine detached house, in ornamented grounds, built by 1842. There was another small enclave of middle-class housing in Newland (around Garmston House) and The Avenue (around Clayton‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Newland House - Hill 1974, 128) the former mostly terraced, the latter (som",Summary,"The main component of the RAZ (north-east of the upper city) is drawn to include the 19th-century houses on the north side of Lindum Terrace, east of the Close Wall.

9d8d28cb-9b5f-429c-9249-43ba31df772c,LARA RAZ AREA,,"House of Industry, the Workhouse and House of the Girls' Friendly Society","Lincoln had been quite early into the field by forming a parish union c.1782 which, over a period of years, was joined by all the urban Lincoln parishes as well as many local rural ones. The House of Industry, as it was called, was housed in a former glue factory behind the Castle (Hill 1966, 179; Wright 1982, 103). This complex is presumably that marked on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1819 map, on the site of St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church. Archaeological remains of the glue factory would be of great interest in their own right (RAZ 11.37), but both the fact that the factory seems to have been established in a former church and the subsequent conversion of this building into a House of Industry add layers of additional importance and interest. We should ask whether the equipment was removed when the factory was converted, or were the first inmates required to continue production of glue, or some other products? A school for the paupers was set up on the premises in the 1820s and this will merit detailed comparisons with the layout and regime of the other Lincoln schools at that date (RAZ 11.61). Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 a new workhouse was planned on up-to-date lines on a new site north-west of the House of Industry, built to the designs of W.A. Nicholson (of Lincoln) in 1837 or 1839 (Hill 1974, 133). The building is known to have been modelled on the principles recommended by central government, but its plan and any surviving details need to be compared with other surviving examples to establish the significance of local variations. In particular we should be interested in evidence, both for the standard of living conditions to be found here (and the extent to which they may improved or degenerated over time) and for the work activities which were required of the inmates. The building was extended in 1879 (architect W. Watkins) and comparison between the details of the original building and its extension may reveal significant changes in the attitudes taken to the unemployed during the central part of the 19th century. A national study of workhouses has provided a valuable research agenda for the topic (Morrison 1999). The Lincoln Workhouse site was contiguous with the Girls' Friendly Society Home (formerly the Lincolnshire Penitent Females' Home, which was a mid-Victorian philanthropic institution (founded and built 1850) aimed at training female paupers for domestic service roles. It was located in a magnificent position on the cliff, overlooking the valley. The plan and architectural development of this building is of some interest as little seems to be known about the circumstances in which the girls lived and were trained. Their living conditions could be usefully compared to those in the Workhouse to the north - indeed there must have been quite close connection between the two institutions which could be explored by future archaeological work.",Summary,"The RAZ is mapped following the boundaries of the three contiguous sites as depicted on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1819 and 1842 maps, and on the 1887 O.S. map.

9dc88913-2828-4c94-b0a0-b38bda928bf7,LARA RAZ AREA,,The mint and jewellery quarter,"Dr Vince has laid out (chapter 9a) the scanty evidence we have for the location of the famous Lincoln Mint - one of the most productive in England in the 10th and 11th centuries (Mossop 1970). The single die and other evidence for metal-working in one of the tenements on Flaxengate (F72) suggest that a moneyer may have been at work here, although the circumstances in which the coin die was lost remain to be explained. This evidence seems to indicate that at this period (the early 11th century) minting was not very clearly focused within the town, or at least it was not housed in a quarter devoted exclusively to the task. By the 13th century, however, a variety of documentary references do suggest that the moneyers were concentrated in a small part of the city along with the jewellers and other metalworkers. As far as we can tell from isolated documentary references this quarter consisted of tenements extending back from the western side of High Street in the parishes of St Peter-at-Arches and St Peter-at-Pleas. We know of only one early building in this area, illustrated in the Willson Collection, before its demolition in 1838 and said to be ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáopposite the Buttermarket‰Û¡ÌÝå», that is opposite the site of the church of St Peter-at-Pleas (Cath Lib. Vol A no.32; Ross Civitas Lincolniae II, 141). The drawing records a timber-framed structure with a pair of shops facing on to High Street. The upper floor contains a run of very elaborate traceried windows, though they are all in wood. The tracery indicates a date in the central part of the 14th century, and may indicate a domestic hall. It is possible, however, that the upper floor, with its dramatic range of windows providing maximum light, lit a long workshop for a trade such as jewellery, where good light is essential and where effective use of space within a building meant creating the maximum number of work-benches underneath windows. This structure may provide an example of the type of specialised accommodation we should be searching for in the RAZ in future work.In the 15th century there is a record of a building called le Cunynghouse in Mint Lane which seems, subsequently, to have been known as the Mint Hall or ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáCoining House‰Û¡ÌÝå». It is hard to see what role such a hall would have played in the medieval Lincoln mint, however, and Prof. Cameron has shown that le Cunynghouse had nothing to do with ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácoining‰Û¡ÌÝå», deriving instead from the surname of the property‰Û¡ÌÝå»s owner (1985, 151). The idea that the building was something to do with the Lincoln mint seems to be an instance of back-formation of the place-name based on the knowledge that the mint was in this general area, but, even so, the building requires special attention to establish its (obviously distinctive) function.Whether the building opposite St Peter-at-Pleas was a workshop above shops or a merchants hall with shops, clearly buildings in this area offer the possibility of exploring this important medieval craft activity and its sociology. In particular we might investigate the extent to which this security conscious industry sought to keep itself secure, and distinct, from surrounding craftsmen. A good research agenda for the topic is provided by Campbell 1991.",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ have been taken to be the block of properties defined by Mint Lane, Mint Street, Park Street and High Street.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.37,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.37,

9df4a258-1193-4621-a65b-88b21ea3a956,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Martin,"St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is one of the most interesting and important church sites in the city. Along with the two St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (-at-Arches and -at-Pleas) it has strong claims to being one of the senior churches of the lower city. The earliest evidence we have for devotion to St Martin in the city comes in the form of the so- called ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáSt Martin Coinage‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Stewart 1967; Mossop 1970, I/7-11; Dolley 1975). The existence of this coinage modelled on the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáSt Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Coinage‰Û¡ÌÝå» of York strongly suggests a church in Lincoln dedicated to the saint at the start of the 10th century. It also suggests, of course, a similar ecclesiastical and commercial situation in Lincoln to that prevailing in York. We have suggested here that the coinage might be a reflection of the importance of St Martin not just as an ecclesiastical patron but as the patron of the city market (RAZ 9.22), which we believe was first laid out on the open hillside around, and north of, the church of St Martin. There are other indications of St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s seniority. It evidently had already lost its owner by 1070x87 when the church was granted to the Bishop by the King and it had become the focus of a relatively valuable prebendal estate before 1135 (ed. Foster 1931, 2, RA .2; Hill 1948, 142; ed. Greenway 1977, 86) and this may be an indication of a church of long-standing. It also occupies a prominent site near the centre of the former Roman enclosure in the north-west angle of the junction between a hypothetical east-west road linking Clasketgate gate and the presumed gatehouse on West Parade, and the dedication to St Martin is also sometimes thought to be indicative of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáconversion‰Û¡ÌÝå» period churches in this country (cf. St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s in Canterbury). Clearly investigations into the antiquity of this important church should be a matter of high priority. It is also the case, however, that this is an interesting and important Lincoln church throughout its whole history. The details of the north arcade suggest that it was rebuilt to an elaborate design in the 13th century and other details (such as the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátrefoil-headed piscina‰Û¡ÌÝå» discovered in the south wall in 1876) suggest that there may have been a comprehensive rebuilding at that date - as there was at St Benedict‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, St Mary-le-Wigford and St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. Its development needs to be considered, therefore, alongside the group of prosperous downhill churches of the 13th century, and as the parish was so dominated by market places it is possible that its fabric will be especially sensitive to the economic downturn of the 14th century. The churchyard must have been much larger than the small area now enclosed in St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Square. Probably it occupied the whole of the square north of a narrower St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane. There may have been no formal road along the north side, but we do know that several markets were held around the churchyard. These include the Hay market, the Butchery and the Poultry market (RAZ 9.22) and these may have had the effect of enlarging the open space around the church, if not necessarily increasing the size of the churchyard. With its potentially early population, St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s will preserve an important group of burials and, as it continued in use for burial until the 19th century, it must preserve one of the longest sequences of burials in the city. It is a site, then, which offers the prospect of understanding how the development of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s physical anthropology through a very long period of time.",Summary,"The south boundary of the RAZ is drawn along the expected south boundary of the churchyard where it is indicated on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map. The west boundary is presumed to lie on Hungate; the east boundary must have lain originally more or less on the line of the properties fronting High Street, whilst the northern boundary is presumed to lie along the south side of Garmston Street (formerly St Martin's Row).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.38,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.38,

9e5ff0ee-59d0-4a57-a5eb-ce9de7815779,LARA RAZ AREA,,Theatres and cinemas,"There had been a theatre in the city since 1732, when a small playhouse was opened in Drury Lane (which was named in its honour) (Hill 1966, 16). Its location has recently been identified on or near the site of Nos. 1-4 Drury Lane and exploring its archaeology must now be a priority. The site should be compared with the small group of approximately contemporary standing buildings nationally, such as those at Richmond (Yorks.) and Bristol (Theatre Royal), looking especially at how the layout ensured that social divisions amongst the clientele were maintained. Finds from the site are likely to cast light on early theatrical equipment.In 1763-4 the theatre was moved to the site north of Clasketgate, where it has operated ever since. The buried remains of the original mid-Georgian theatre here will be of considerable interest and should be compared with any results from the Drury Lane site as well as with contemporary theatres in London, which are quite well known. The Lincoln Theatre Royal was completely rebuilt in 1806 but destroyed by fire in 1892. The architects of the new theatre (Crewe and Sprague of London) created a standardised example within the shell of the old building and, although smaller and more primitive than the West End theatres of the day, Lincoln remains an important provincial example. With such a long period of development on the site the Theatre Royal offers an important opportunity for the study of the development of theatrical design and future work on the site should be accompanied by proposals for archaeological recording and study.The Alhambra was established behind the Green Dragon at the corner of Broadgate and Waterside North in 1850s but it does not seem to have survived long as a theatre (Clark 1991,4) and this time restriction may have a beneficial result for theatre archaeologists in closely-dated artefacts. This building might have been the predecessor of the Temperance Hall which was succeeded by the New Central Hall in St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Square (opened in 1902 - architect W. Mortimer of Lincoln) and also intended to capitalise on the market for vaudeville before World War One. Like many such theatres, however, it was converted to a cinema, the Central, c.1920 and destroyed by fire in 1944. The New Central Hall continued to serve the temperance movement and this temperance background means that comparisons with the Palace Theatre (below) will be particularly interesting. There will be many similarities, but the differences in plan form and architectural detail may tell us something of the aspirations of the temperance movement in these its latter days. The Palace Theatre Newland had an extended life. It was originally built as a Masonic Hall in 1872 (architect William Watkins) but by 1877 it had been adapted for use for ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoperatic and dramatic performances‰Û¡ÌÝå» and it also served as a hall for boxing and furniture sales. In 1901 it was re-opened as the Empire Theatre of Varieties and in 1902 as a vaudeville theatre called The Palace in which guise it continued until 1931 when it was converted to The Plaza Cinema (Clarke 1991, 20-21). It was demolished after a fire in 1943. This long evolution as a place of entertainment makes this an interesting and important site for future investigations. Buried remains should be able to show how the needs of the increasingly sophisticated audience were catered for. The first Lincoln cinemas were temporary installations in buildings used for other purposes, such as St Hughs Church hall, Monks Road. It was used as a ""Picture Hall"" cinema in 1909 and is thought to have been Lincoln's first venue used as a cinema. Indeed the first dedicated establishment (the Corn Exchange Cinema of 1911) was not just an interesting conversion of an existing building but a reversible one (see RAZ 11.21). The first truly purpose-built cinema, the Grand Electric Cinema at Garmston House at the top end of High Street was, even so, still an extensive conversion (Clark 1991, 1",Summary,The RAZ areas are mapped using boundaries depicted on various O.S. map editions and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.74,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.74,

This would place the market in a street near the line of the modern street called Thorngate and would connect the market here with the space at the east end of Saltergate, which became (at a later period) the sheep market (RAZ 10.22.10). Furthermore, if this is the correct location, the Maltmarket of the 13th and early 14th century is likely to have been transformed into the Staple Place of the later Middle Ages as the latter is thought to have occupied a similar space west of the wing-wall between the Greyfriary and the river (RAZ 10.3). Although the staple was moved to Lincoln in 1326 (Hill 1948, 248-9), Staple Place is not recorded as a place-name until 1354 (Cameron 1985, 41). The final medieval reference to the Maltmarket given by Cameron, on the other hand, dates from 1349 (1985, 29). Is it possible that the name of the Maltmarket and presumably its main function were changed around 1350?The South Riding of Lindsey was a notable area for the production of malt (Platts 1985 110), and some of the malt on sale at the market must have been produced in the countryside around the city. It is also likely, however, that some of the malt will have been produced in the city itself, and this raises the question whether the maltmarket was sited to assist any city maltings. Were there, for example, maltings extending back from Saltergate towards the river? Such a site would have given maltsters access to river water for steeping the grains at the rear of their properties, whilst the finished, kilned, malt at the end of the process would have been at the Saltergate end of the property - ready to be sold on the street and transported. There were probably two maltings laid out in precisely this way in the 19th century (Herridge 1999, 5486 - RAZ 11.38). Research work on the Maltmarket, then, should be looking not just for confirmation that it was malt which was sold here, but also the possibility that it was located conveniently close to malting houses, which were perhaps to the west. The hypothesis that, in the second quarter of the 14th century, the maltmarket was transformed into the Staple Place (i.e. the wool market) should also be investigated. Presumably such a transformation would have left a mark in the layout of the market place itself and, perhaps in the provision of different types of furniture. If demonstrated, the transformation itself, of course, would be an excellent symbol of the dramatic changes in the local economy in the early 14th century; from the production and marketing of a foodstuff, supplying the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s resident population, to the marketing of a commodity produced in the countryside and worked in cities abroad. The replacement of the Maltmarket with the Staple would symbolise Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s change from being a centre of labour and production to being a mere tax-point and storehouse.",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries are drawn to include the largest likely area of the market and also the properties facing on to it, which may have played a role in servicing the market. It extends from the city wall on the eastern side to a point 100m to the west. The western boundary is intended to include a property on this side of any open space in order to permit assessment of whether or not its occupation relates to the market itself. The southern boundary is likely to have been along the river, whilst the northern boundary is drawn along the southern boundary of the Greyfriars‰Û¡ÌÝå» precinct.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.23.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.23.2,

9f090847-9b18-47fe-8cbb-9ea220d85422,LARA RAZ AREA,,Presbyterian or Independent Chapel in Upper Wigford,"There were several conventicles of Presbyterians and Independents in the city by the late 18th century although most have obscure histories (Hill 1966, 68-9). One is better documented, however. Beginning as early as 1672, it was supported by the Disney family, in whose house, in St Peter-at-Gowts parish at the time, they used to meet. This group called themselves 'Presbyterian' in 1719, but they were 'Independent' by 1774 (Ibid.) and the congregation became Unitarian in 1837 (Hill 1974, 184). They built a chapel on the east side of High Street in c.1725, which still survives on the corner of the later Monson Street and High Street (Hill 1966, 68). The chapel is another rare building type, and although it has been altered several times, each alteration is an expression of changing creeds within the dissenting congregation and should, therefore, be recorded in detail during the course of repair works. A useful research agenda for the topic may be found in CBA 1985 and Gilchrist and Morris 1996.",Summary,"The RAZ includes the whole plot on which the chapel stands on the presumption that the surrounding ground may have been used for burial, or for other purposes associated with the conventicle, which may have left an impression in the archaeological record.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.65,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.65,

9f17d0c5-4844-493d-aa6c-a16375973a03,LARA RAZ AREA,,Stamp End Causeway,"Important information about the Roman conquerors' attitude to the presumed sacred pools of the Corieltauvi may be expressed in any alterations or destruction levels in the vicinity of the Stamp End causeway, which might tell us something about its fate, once the new ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáWigford‰Û¡ÌÝå» causeway was constructed (RAZ 6.2). If the early Roman building on the sand island at HG72 can be interpreted as an early Roman ritual building replacing an Iron Age building of similar ritual significance (RAZ 6.3), then we might expect, not outright destruction of the earlier causeway, but its adaptation and Romanisation. This may be exactly what is implied by the deposition of a group of Roman spearheads among votive deposits of weapons of Bronze-Age to Medieval date, discovered below Stamp End Lock (Whitwell 1970, 15 & n; Stocker and Everson 2003), and future research work in the zone should explore the issue further. At the northern end of the causeway, however, there is some evidence to suggest that the Witham to the east of Lincoln was being used to transport military supplies (RAZ 6.10) and this might imply more complex alterations here. If the Romans made any attempts to control the flow of water in the early Brayford Pool, as we think was done in later periods, then any surviving structural evidence will be found at the northern end of the Stamp End causeway, and these will require detailed examination.",Summary,"The boundaries of the causeway are not certain. It almost certainly changed lines many times throughout its existence. RAZ 6.4 is intended to include, not only the causeway structures, but a strip at least 100m wide to either side, because it is in the adjacent zones next to the causeway structures than most votive deposits associated with it have been discovered. The northern boundary is drawn south of the medieval and later Winn Street, along the approximate line of the 5m contour.

There has been some study of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáterritorium‰Û¡ÌÝå» that may have been dedicated to the support of the legionary base at Gloucester, and estimates of its size have ranged between 35 and 70 square miles (Hurst 1988, 68-9). In his account Hurst suggests that the legion will have drawn on their territorium for the supply of grain, fruit and vegetables as well as cattle (for leather as well as meat and milk), sheep (for meat, milk and textile), horses and pigs. It is also likely that supplies of timber and stone would have been drawn from the nearest available sources, which may also have been within the territorium and reserved for the legion‰Û¡ÌÝå»s use. There is no evidence for the boundary of Gloucester‰Û¡ÌÝå»s territorium, but it has been suggested that the territorium of Inchtuthill was marked by physical boundaries in the landscape (Collingwood and Richmond 1969, 73).Given the large area dedicated to the exclusive support for the fortress at Gloucester, it is likely that Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s dedicated territorium extended way beyond the modern District Council Boundary, and therefore any boundary features are likely to have been way outside our study area. Even so, the identification of the territorium is important for our understanding of the military occupation and the City Archaeologist should engage in archaeological research work outside the District boundary with the aim of identifying its boundaries (either through the identification of boundary structures or through analysis of distribution patterns of artefacts of distinctively military character). Within the District boundary the existence of the territorium will provide an excellent opportunity to study the impact of Roman military agricultural techniques, both when compared with any pre-existing Late Pre-Roman Iron-Age techniques and with contemporary Romano-British techniques outside areas of military occupation. In the valley floor, we might expect to find pasture land, and here boundaries with stock-proof enclosures might be expected. The ditches of any such field systems might contain important environmental deposits which will help in understanding the impact of the establishment of the territorium on the local agricultural and natural environment. Any such boundaries are also likely to be valuable, in establishing whether they were laid out orthogonally with the fortress. On the pasture land the remains of small buildings used in stock management might be expected. The hill-top lands offer the lightest soils, and we need to explore the possibility that these areas were used for arable. Such arable agriculture may have been more centrally organised than the stock-raising and further sites like that identified at Bishop Grosseteste College might be expected (RAZ 6.17).Any evidence for quarrying of the limestone, ironstone or clay along the cliff edge dating from the military era will be of very great interest (RAZ 6.22), but we should note that most of the earliest buildings of the fortress were of timber. Consequently work both within and outside the RAZ (for example in RAZ 6.22 and 6.23) should explore the possibility either that there was extensive clearance of indigenous woodland as a result of the invasion, or even that some deliberate plantations were established.",Summary,"This RAZ includes all of the ground on the north side of the river and out to the city boundary, which has not been allocated a more specific archaeological identity. It is possible, however, that the territorium extended south of the Witham and included natural resources like the woodland on Boultham Moor (RAZ 6.23) and fish and fowl in the wetlands along the rivers (RAZ 6.24 and 6.25).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.18,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.18,

She has shown that the dedication was particularly popular at the court of King Cnut, and that the dedication may have been used particularly for military chapels. Although this explanation of the dedication may be relevant to our understanding of the St Clement in Bail (RAZ 9.60.31), it is not yet clear how a church in Butwerk would fit into Crawford‰Û¡ÌÝå»s patterning of St Clement distributions. Here, rather it might have been more relevant that St Clement was the patron saint of seamen and it is likely that the church of St Clement was close to the river. Consequently, the most instructive comparisons with St Clement might be with St Augustine (RAZ 9.60.11), which occupied a similar position on the river, but closer to the city. Through a process of elimination (chapter 9a) Dr Vince shows that St Clement is likely to be the second of the two churches which Colswein built on his new urban estate founded between 1066 and 1086. As with St Peter ad Fontem (RAZ 9.60.12), the survival of this rare documentation for the foundation of the church makes the archaeological site one of exceptional importance amongst the churches of Lincoln. As at St Peter, piecemeal investigation is not appropriate in such circumstances and every effort must be made to mount a comprehensive campaign of work. Such a campaign might be aimed at, for example, investigating the whole burial ground rather than just small parts of it and at recovering the maximum structural information about the church itself.",Summary,"Following detailed documentary research by Mr Johnson and Dr Vince we are now able to propose a likely site for the church. A plot of land in the extreme eastern end of the suburb belonged to the rectory of St Peter at Arches, the city church, from at least 1577. Dr Vince has proposed (chapter 9a) that the site of the church is to be located through Willson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s references to a group of burials located west of Sparrow Lane. Mr Johnson believes that further confirmation of this site is provided by the tenemental histories of the plots to the south and north.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.13,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.13,

a1b2f332-1567-47df-ab62-b8e96f18cf2d,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hospital,"The complicated story of the religious institution outside the west gate of the castle has been sketched out by Dr Vince (chapter 9). It seems clear that it started life as an ordinary parish church dedicated to St Bartholomew, which could theoretically have been founded at any date in the 10th or 11th century, prior to its first documentary reference in the late 12th century (Cameron 1985, 118). Dr Vince shows, however, that it is likely that the whole suburb, presumably including the parish church, is later in date than the late 11th century, as no pottery of any earlier date has been recovered from the area. With the decline of the suburb in the 13th century, however, the parish church seems to have been transformed in 1297 into a chapel serving an additional graveyard of the Minster (Hill 1948, 146). At about the same time (references occur between 1312 and 1331 - Cameron 1985, ed. Page 1906, 234), a hospital for the sick with a master and brethren was established. To add further confusion at almost the same moment (i.e. between 1301 and 1312) there are a much smaller number of references to a leper hospital of St Leonard outside the castle (ed. Page 1906, 233). It remains unclear whether St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s were the same institution under different names or whether they were distinct but adjacent establishments. Whichever, it seems likely that, in addition to serving as a burial chapel for the cathedral community, the redundant parish church became the focus of at least one hospital for the sick. No doubt the cathedral would have placed their own sick here, but its development might also have been stimulated by the presence of the Battle Place, at or near which we have noted that judicial executions took place (RAZ 9.46). We have already seen in our discussion of the Malandry (RAZ 9.56 ) that, because of their symbolic marginality to society, leper hospitals were thought to be appropriate institutions to be granted a role in the burial of criminals. As at the Malandry (RAZ 9.56), the physical layout of the buildings of the institution will be of very great interest, simply because hospital plans are very various and also very informative at a symbolic level, and many of the points made with respect to the Malandry research agenda also apply at St Bartholomew's. Similarly, the graveyard, with its mixed population of parishioners, cathedral staff, the leprous and the condemned will be of considerable paleo-anthropological interest; as at the Malandry, efforts should be made to capture the entire remaining population in a single project (although, given the subdivision of the area, this may be very difficult to achieve). In effect this is, for a period at least, the northern equivalent of The Malandry in the south of the town and, consequently, all investigations here should be accompanied by comparisons with the larger institution in Lower Wigford.",Summary,"As none have been recovered, the RAZ boundaries are all speculative. We can say that the church and hospital were sited to the north-west of Battle Place, whose location is approximately fixed (RAZ 9.46). Similarly we know, from many early post-medieval references (Cameron 1985, 189) that there was a close between St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and the cliff edge in which a windmill or mills were established (RAZ 9.43). This leaves us with a long rectilinear strip of land bounded by Cliffgate on the north side. It is likely (at least during earlier stages in the development of the suburb), that the frontage along this street was partly occupied with houses (RAZ 9.27). An eastern boundary to the St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s RAZ has been drawn, therefore, along a line which marks the extent of the burials found on LH84, LA85 and L86. It is possible, however, that other parts of the hospital were located in RAZ 9.27, to the west of this position. The eastern boundary of the RAZ is entirely notional. It has been drawn along the line of the long-standing property boundary which divides the Lawn Hospital grounds from the land further to the west. The date of this boundary is unknown. The southern boundary also marks the approximate southern extent of medieval archaeological features found during the excavations.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.57,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.57,

a2240f4a-9b17-4f69-b075-8300b1289bb4,LARA RAZ AREA,,Smithies,"Lincoln must have always been supplied with ironwork by many smithies and, at earlier periods some of the iron may have been quarried locally (RAZ 9.41.1; 9.41.2; 10.41.1; 10.41.2). Unfortunately it is not until the 19th century that we are able to identify smithy locations in any numbers. The early smithies must have played an important part in the development of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economy from the mid 18th century onwards; the new business based on the waterways would have provided a large market for ironwork producers and each site needs to be investigated with this in mind. Some of the smithies must have been drawn into producing specialist ironwork, such as for boat-building, even before the coming of the railways, but their arrival must have provided a further, and greater, stimulus. The later 18th century was a period of great advances in the handling of metal and these early smithies should reflect the development of such techniques. More important for our appreciation of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s industrial development is an understanding of the role played by the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s early smithies in developing the iron-working skills which would play a critical role in the development of heavy engineering once the railways arrived. Future archaeological work on smithies, then, must aim to understand the development of skills amongst the workforce to see if techniques had improved since the 1750s and were still improving in the 1840s. These matters might be accessible, for example, through metallurgical studies of deposits containing hammerscale. We should also be interested in establishing where the iron itself was produced and how it came to the city. Presumably much iron was imported in bulk by canal, but this aspect of the local iron working industry has yet to be explored and, if true, we may expect a marked change in local smithies when the Fossdyke re-opened in 1744. There is only one surviving building of this vintage left in the city, the Pask family smithy at 72, Park Street (built perhaps c.1850 - Herridge 1999, No.5050). The fabric of the building will retain much evidence for the various techniques employed in the smithy whilst deposits of hammer-scale etc. below the floor will be of considerable metallurgical interest. Research agendas for this sort of metal working have been established by Crossley (1994; forthcoming).With the arrival of the major heavy industrial plants in the 1840s and 1850s we should presume that the market for the output of small-scale smithies will have changed dramatically, as the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s industrial needs would now be provided by in-house workshops. However, small smithies continued to trade, perhaps depending more and more on farrier work. This change in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s iron-working economy should be visible in both buried and structural remains of smithies in use in the later 19th century. These include the smithy of Joseph West at 4 Gibbeson Street and the example at the corner of West Parade and Hungate (Herridge 1999, No.5065, 5583).",Summary,The RAZ includes the buildings depicted as smithies on the 1st edition O.S. map.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.35,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.35,

This, at least, is the implication of Dr Neal‰Û¡ÌÝå»s assessment of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápalatial scale and quality‰Û¡ÌÝå» of the mosaics, and the plan form, with a large courtyard surrounded by (probably) four immense corridors with mosaics, in advance of the main accommodation. Although it may have contained suites of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» rooms, in the role of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáofficial residence‰Û¡ÌÝå» it will have been the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» rooms towards which greatest contemporary attention will have been directed. Nor can its siting be accidental. When seen from the brow of Canwick Hill, at the point where the Roman road descends into the valley, the city and Forum buildings will have crowned the ridge due north; but separated from the city a little to the east, will have been this second highly imposing group of buildings. Like the palace at Fishbourne (Sussex) and also, perhaps, the villae within the ditches demarcating the oppida at Bagendon and Gorhambury, the Greetwell ‰Û¡ÌÝÌávilla‰Û¡ÌÝå» lies within the LPRIA ditch systems.The question of whether this building does represent a specialised ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» residence will be addressed, first, by the establishment of the plan of the building. Recovery of the plan of the site and the definition of its surrounding complex should be a high priority for work on the Colonia Era. Environmental work in this area, especially in the grounds of the palace, might be able to establish any distinctive planting which could be associated with gardens or with the cultivation of exotic food plants.",Summary,"The complex might have been very much larger than the residence itself, so the RAZ boundary takes in a very large area. It is constrained, however, by the known cemeteries to the west and by Wragby Road to the north. To the east lay, in the Roman Military Era anyway, the Iron Age ditch system, which places the Greetwell Villa inside the Lincoln dyke system and so invites comparison with the palace at Fishbourne, which lies inside the Chichester dykes system. The southern boundary of the villa estate could well have been the river itself. Certainly the cliff face would have formed an important part of the setting of the residence, and terraced gardens in the Mediterranean manner on the slopes are at least a possibility. The large estate defined by these boundaries is significantly similar to the estate which was subsequently to become the estate held by St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey during the medieval period (RAZ 8.1.3 and 9.55.2), and this raises the possibility that there may have been some continuity between the late Roman and the High Medieval period in the matter of estate boundaries. Any such continuity would be similar to that perceived by Finberg (1959; Wilkinson, Prosser and Holbrook 1995) in monastic estates at the other end of the limestone escarpment in Gloucestershire. The possibility (however remote) that the Greetwell Villa estate became the core of an important monastic holding is of very great interest and it makes archaeological work along the boundaries of the known monastic estate an urgent priority. The validity of the theory will be most easily tested along the proposed boundaries of the estate - where special attention should be directed in the course of future work. Small-scale excavation work could pay large dividends if it demonstrates that the medieval boundaries follow the same lines as Roman ones.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.23,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.23,

This is probably because there were very few habitations here for most of the period. The pottery evidence (described by Dr Vince in chapter 9a) suggests that intensive occupation had disappeared from this area by the late 13th century. The suburb still contained the city gallows, which occupied the plot of land north of Westgate immediately outside the ditch by the time of Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1722. St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s chapel and its burial ground continued in use (RAZ 10. 60.3), but the associated hospital (RAZ 9.57) seems to have disappeared in the 14th century. The archaeological interest in the areas of former domestic occupation, therefore, is restricted to trying to understand the process of decline and disappearance of the suburb. Was it a single process or was it deserted over a period of time? It would also be helpful to understand what uses took the places of the houses - was the land turned over to grazing, for example, or did it come under the plough as part of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s North Field?",Summary,The RAZ has the same boundaries as 9.27.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.27,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.27,

The area is largely in agricultural use and as a result the landscape is characterised by a rectilinear pattern of fields defined by shallow open wet drainage dykes and hedgesThe area is predominantly used for arable or cattle-grazed pasture. The rectilinear pattern of fields and drains are often bordered by well-established and overgrown hedgerows that include both small trees and shrubs, typical of the quick set hedges used during late 18th and early 19th century enclosure. The farmland areas include arable fields, damp cattle-grazed pasture and species-diverse old hedges, many of which are overgrown. There are also several small areas of woodland, grazed scrubland, playing fields and linear stretches of wild flowers along farm tracks and footpaths. The former Skewbridge landfill tip in the north east of the area is a former landfill site that is now covered by rough grassland and widespread scrub, and grazed by horses. The Character Area forms part of the rural foreground to historic views of the Cathedral and north escarpment from the south and west. As such, the views form part of Lincolns‰Û¡ÌÝå» rural hinterland both when approaching Lincoln and when looking out from elevated parts of the city (e.g. north escarpment). Skewbridge is a transitional area between the city and its rural hinterland. This close connection of countryside and town is an important characteristic of Lincoln, contributing to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s rural setting and maintaining a relationship between the market centre and its rural hinterland that has existed for almost two millennia. Skewbridge and the undeveloped areas along the River Witham to the east of the city, together contribute to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhour-glass‰Û¡ÌÝå» shape of the built up area of the city.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 19,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,70,

The southern boundary is formed by Unity Square, the top of the car park on Friars Lane, the rear of the plots at 9-25 Rosemary Lane and the rear and side of the former Wesleyan School on Rosemary Lane. The area includes Friars Lane, Rosemary Lane, Spa Buildings, the east side of Broadgate, north side of Unity Square and south side of Monks Road.St. Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s has an urban residential, commercial and civic townscape with a largely medieval street pattern, varied plot size, and mainly Victorian buildings. Many earlier townscape elements survive including the routes of Roman and medieval streets (including parts of Monks Road that lie on the alignment of a Roman road and medieval streets such as Friars Lane), the Roman and medieval city defences which can still be seen in the line of Broadgate (which was built on a filled-in defensive ditch), pre-1842 field boundaries that have influenced the lines of streets and property boundaries, and Victorian civic buildings. Its long history of development has provided a relatively wide variety of building styles, sizes and forms within a small area. The mainly two to three storey buildings of various forms face on to the streets and give a strong sense of enclosure. The buildings are of red Albion and yellow brick with shallow pitched roofs of Welsh slate or pantiles. The area extends the dense urban form from the city centre although it is largely cut off by Broadgate. It is also very different from the areas of large, open plots with limited pedestrian movement to the south and east. Buildings along Monks Road and Broadgate are larger and feature more elaborate detailing than those in the rest of the area. Some restoration work has been carried out to properties along Monks Road including restoration of original features such as crestings on bay windows. St. Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church is a survival of the Victorian infrastructure.The streets are mainly overlooked by regularly spaced doors and windows although there are some areas where car-parks face directly onto the streets. Monks Road and Broadgate carry a heavy volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and contain most of the commercial activity whilst the remainder of the area has a quieter urban character.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 21,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,50,

a593e4b8-69af-4101-ae0d-ddbebca4ff37,LARA RAZ AREA,,Houses within the southern suburb,"It seems clear from discoveries at BWE82 and SB85 that the south bank of the river was not used as a commercial quayside. Land here was reclaimed gradually for use for other functions, presumably relating to domestic and commercial development along Ermine Street. Although some ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhorizontal‰Û¡ÌÝå» bracing might have been used for mooring small boats, peat was allowed to accumulate in the shallows adjacent to the river bank and fish traps were set in the shallow water. We have already seen that both the Wigford causeway itself and early Roman structures along its course (eg. the building on the HG72 site - RAZs 6.3 & 7.20) probably had a ritual significance as well as a functional one. Consequently, in the Colonia Era, we should be sensitive to similar transformations of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» space to ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» space in this area. Although the rectilinear building on the HG72 site may best be seen as a strip building of the type known elsewhere along the Wigford causeway, the fact that the buildings which came before and after it on the site may be seen as ritual in character (RAZ 7.21) suggests that we should consider a ritual use in this phase also. This possible continuity of a ritual use at the HG72 structure may suggest that the transition from ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» space to ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» between the 2nd and the 4th centuries was not through-going. Even so, late-Roman strip-buildings, which are presumed to have a commercial use, which were laid out on land reclaimed from the sacred pool, for example at SM76, and this clearly illustrates a transition from ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» to ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» use. This transformation suggests, at least, a commodification of the indigenous gods, but it might indicate a more profound change from animistic gods ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápresent‰Û¡ÌÝå» in landscape features, towards humanised deities of the Mediterranean type resident in carefully delineated temples - cf. RAZ 7.20. The ‰Û¡ÌÝÌástone house‰Û¡ÌÝå» with reported mosaics discovered near Monson Street in 1845 still represents an anomaly. It is the only reported house of this apparent late-Roman date and quality so far from the walls. If it really is a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» house comparable with those inside the walls, some exceptional reason should be sought to explain its detached location. But it might be preferable to view it as another temple structure, given its location in the southern suburb, not far from the proposed temple at HG72 and in the general vicinity of the proposed temple of Mithras. Mr Jones reports that the excavations at M82 nearby recovered fragments of a late 3rd-century ceramic figure of an unidentified god. Even so, it is clear that strip buildings remained in this suburb well into the 4th century, at a time when much of the city was given up to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» houses of the rural elite. Indeed Mr Jones considers it possible that the dwellers in these buildings were forced out of the lower city by the new elite associated with the provincial government in the 4th century (chapter 7a). Clearly this important idea can be tested by looking more closely at the foundation dates for the earliest strip buildings. This juxtaposition, with the elite within the walls and an urban artisanal class relegated to large suburbs has not been found widely in late Roman Britain and we need to consider unusual economic models that would accommodate both types of structures in a single economy. One model might envisage the city supporting a community of specialist artisans, who spent part of their time participating in the adjacent rural economy, working within their specialist expertise only when it seemed likely that would be a market for their products. An alternative model might see the southern suburb in the late Roman period being more exclusively devoted to ritual or administrative activities and these workshops belonging, essentially, to adherents either of the priesthood or of the administrators. In this second case artisans might be viewed as harbingers of the relationships between lords and craftsmen more familiar f",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ are drawn to include all those areas south of the Witham where it is thought likely that ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» dwellings of all characters and classes might have been located.

Of particular interest will be precise dates for the laying out of such new enclosures on the former common. Do they coincide with the collapse of the cloth industry in the late 13th century, with the Black Death in the mid 14th century or with the period of engrossment of landholdings and the replacement of arable with pasture in the 15th and early 16th century? Such dating evidence will be important for our understanding of the early modern economic development of the city, and should be assessed in future work.On the far side (west) of West Common the Enclosure Award of 1803 shows a group of enclosed closes along the city boundary. These seem to have belonged to the farm known as Waves Farm and their date of enclosure is unknown. It is perhaps most likely that they were enclosed by private treaty during the later 18th century (RAZ 11.14), but it is possible that they were already enclosed during the Early Modern Era. The date of enclosure can be tested both by excavating sections across the field boundaries marked (for example) on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map and/or by establishing the date of foundation of the earliest of the various sites marked on the 1887 O.S. map as housing Waves Farm itself.",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ have been drawn using historic mapping (enclosure award, Padley 1842 and 1887 OS).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.8.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.8.1,

a5f8daa2-1b0d-475c-993f-fdcae8a9f5e3,LARA RAZ AREA,,Tram system,"The Lincoln tram system was a simple network as the steep hill made access to the upper city from the lower difficult. The scheme granted permission in 1880 was planned to run from Bracebridge to St Benedict‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Square along High Street, and from Carholme to the Arboretum, but it seems that only the High Street route was ever built. Initially the system was operated by horse-haulage, but it was electrified in 1905. The tramway ceased operation in 1929. The remains of the tram rails and of the metal studs that provided power supply will be encountered during routine road works and should be recorded when revealed. At present little seems to be known of the engineering involved in the electric power system, although Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s should be compared with those in cities which are better understood. A research agenda for some structures of this type is provided in the Step 1 Report for the Electricity Industry (Trueman 1994). It is known, however, that the Griffith-Bedell system of transmission, by which power was supplied by studs in the road, was rare and technologically complex (White 1989, 114). Any surviving remains of this early power system will be of interest, and might be seen as a civic reflection of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s interest in innovative industrial technology in the years leading up to the First World War. The conversion to electricity followed the takeover of the system by the City Council is one of several examples of late-Victorian reclamation of public enterprise from the private sector, and might be seen as a civic gesture towards innovation in industry. Perhaps because of its technological sophistication, the power system did not work well and in 1919 a conventional overhead power supply was constructed. The stanchions for this supply are likely to be encountered during road works and should be recorded.The depot at the southern end of the system survives, at the corner of Newark Road and Ellison Street, Bracebridge (Herridge 1999, 5059), bearing the datestone of 1882. This is a relatively rare survival of this category of building nationally and it requires careful recording during repair and/or conversion. Not only will important technical information be available buried in the floor, but the measures taken to convert the horse tram system to run on electricity will be of considerable interest, particularly as the transmission system used was so novel.",Summary,The RAZ boundary is marked by the outer edges of the pavement of High Street as depicted on the 1st edition O.S. between St Benedict‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Square and the terminus at Bracebridge.

Foster 1931, 2, RA. 2; Hill 1948, 141-2). Unlike St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, however, the prebend to which St Lawrence was attached was named after the Lindsey church of Carlton Paynell (South Carlton) (ed. Greenway 1977, 58). Even so we might expect the church on this prominent site alongside the High Street to be relatively early in date and Hill speculated that the church might be dedicated in recollection of the dispatch of the relics of St Lawrence to Northumbria in 667, or alternatively that Lawrence Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 619) was commemorated (Hill 1948,37). Whatever the value of these speculations, it is clear that further work within the RAZ should address the possibility of a pre-Viking origin for the church, even though we may have fewer indications of a pre-Viking date here than we have in the cases of St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s to the north or the two St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s to the south.As with St Martin, also, we might expect this church to have been quite a large and sophisticated building. We have little understanding of its architectural development, but we might expect it too to have been comprehensively rebuilt in the 13th century, like other buildings of its class in the city. In about 1297 an important chantry was founded here (Hill 1948, 152), and this chantry was the subject of further grants in the 14th century. The archaeological remains of this relatively well documented chantry will be of great interest and we should expect some modification of the fabric to accommodate it.",Summary,"The church site is known, as it survived in use as a secular unit owned by the City Council after the Reformation.

The boundary was probably that referred to in 1455 as Cheviot Wall (Cameron 1985, 58). We have no reason to think that this boundary was ever a serious military feature, but the gate through it might have acted as some sort of control point in the Early Modern Era, and remains of this date should be sought out in future research. Both the wall and the gate at Butwerk need to be compared with what appear to be similar features defining the western boundary of the Newland suburb (RAZ 9.51.3), and the sequence of repair and maintenance needs to be related to the disputes between the city and the owners of Monks Leas estate.",Summary,"The RAZ presumes a wall with a ditch 20m across outside it.

It is constructed of cast iron resting on brick piers set into the river banks. The bridge is primarily of interest in demonstrating that the tow path was still thought to worth protecting as late as 1907, but it may also be thought that the poor quality of design demonstrated by the bridge indicates that the tow path (along with the system of transport it represented) was no longer viewed as prestigious.

aa34f4b1-bf07-4a00-9c84-8a6067d77a56,LARA RAZ AREA,,Area of centuriation around the city,"Many studies have identified the likely presence of large areas of land surrounding Roman coloniae devoted to agricultural production and services which were dedicated to the service of the city rather than the local population. Agriculture and services in these areas were theoretically highly specialised as they consisted of parcels of land given to retired army veterans, who would then use the land to support themselves and their families. Little is known about how this worked, but archaeology might help in understanding the process. Was the land actually worked by the veterans or their families, or were they acting as landlords for resident natives? This is a judgement which can be made on the evidence of material cultural remains, at least at earlier dates, and this question should form the background to further research work in the RAZ. Hurst has attempted to assess the productivity of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácenturiated‰Û¡ÌÝå» area surrounding the colonia at Gloucester, based on the assumption that this area was very similar to, if not the same as, the legionary territorium (Hurst 1988, 68-9). Estimates of the size of this area have ranged between 35 and 70 square miles. As a very similar type of foundation we might expect that the territorium at Lincoln was also converted into the area of centuriation following the foundation of the colonia. The validity of this assumption might be tested in studies of agricultural settlement in the area around the city, by attempting to judge whether or not there was a continuity of material culture between the Military and Colonia Eras at sites like the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáfarm‰Û¡ÌÝå» at Bishop Grosseteste College (RAZ 6.17, 7.7). In his account Hurst observes that the colonia will have drawn on the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácenturiated area‰Û¡ÌÝå» for the supply of grain, fruit and vegetables as well as cattle (for leather as well as meat and milk), sheep (for meat milk and textile), horses and pigs. It is also likely that supplies of timber and stone would have been drawn from the nearest available sources, which may also have been within this regulated zone and reserved for the colonia's use. Given the large areas involved, it is highly likely that Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácenturiated area‰Û¡ÌÝå» extended way beyond the modern District Council boundary, and therefore any Romano-British boundary features (for which there is no British evidence) are likely to have been way outside our study area. Even so, the identification of the extent of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácenturiated area‰Û¡ÌÝå» is vital for our understanding of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economy and the City Archaeologist should take an interest in archaeological research work outside the District boundary with the aim of identifying its boundaries (either through the identification of boundary structures or through analysis of distribution patterns of artefacts of distinctively military character). Within the District boundary the existence of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácenturiated area‰Û¡ÌÝå» will provide an excellent opportunity to study the impact of Roman agricultural techniques, both when compared with any pre-existing Late Pre-Roman Iron-Age techniques and with contemporary Romano-British techniques in areas beyond those controlled by coloniae.In the valley floor, we might expect to find pasture land, and here boundaries with stock-proof enclosures might be expected. The ditches of any such field systems might contain important environmental deposits which will help in understanding the impact of the establishment of the territorium on the local agricultural and natural environment. Any such boundaries will also be valuable in establishing whether they were laid out orthogonally with the colonia walls. On the pasture land the remains of small buildings used in stock management might be expected. The hill-top lands offer the lightest soils, and we need to explore the possibility that these areas were used for arable. Such arable agriculture may have been more centrally organised than the stock-raising and further sites like that identified at Bishop Grosseteste C",Summary,"This RAZ includes all of the ground on both sides of the river and out to the city boundary, and overlaps several other RAZs which have been allocated a more specific archaeological identity (7.3, 7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.9, 7.11.2, 7.11.3, 7.11.5, 7.19, 7.23, 7.24, 7.25).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.14,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.14,

It is a tunnel arch bridge of stone and brick with stone courses with ornamental parapets. A research agenda for structures of this type has been established in the Step 1 Report (OAU 1998). It is possible that surviving fabric from the earlier pair of bridges was reused to form the new bridge and archaeological recording during repair work is necessary to understand the extent to which the surviving bridge encapsulates earlier structures. The new bridge was designed by Alderman William Hayward and erected at city expense. The connection between engineer and patron might have led to conflict in the bridge‰Û¡ÌÝå»s construction, and survey work should address the question of the quality of the bridge construction.

ab186416-2c35-416c-b802-33d22662e1c3,LARA RAZ AREA,,The Malandry (the Hospital of the Holy Innocents),"The documentary record suggests that the Malandry Leper Hospital went through a number of major changes in the late medieval period. Most significantly the hospital was granted to Burton Lazars in Leicestershire on the condition that the King‰Û¡ÌÝå»s servants would be admitted here if they became lepers (ed. Page 1906, 231). Archaeological research should be able to cast light on the question of whether the gift of the hospital to Burton Lazars came about because of a decline in population at Malandry, or whether it indicated a success. Burton Lazars had a well developed rule and we should investigate whether or not there were changes in layout of buildings or in the functions of individual buildings which can be related to its adoption at Malandry. In 1553 the site was granted to William Cecil and included a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácapital messuage‰Û¡ÌÝå», six cottages and a garden. Clearly, then, like St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and Monks‰Û¡ÌÝå» Abbey, this site had also been converted to serve as a great house and archaeological information about it would be very welcome. It survived long enough for a crude depiction of it to be placed in the Bucks‰Û¡ÌÝå» 1724 panorama and for a plan to be made by Dr Cookson (1843). In particular we might investigate whether the conversion simply ignored the pervious regular history of the site or whether any consciousness was shown of the previous function. Clearly there is a discussion to be had about the extent to which people of the Early Modern Era were conscious of the possibility of disease being communicable; any evidence from sites such as this which suggest that any parts of the site were treated with particular care will be of interest. The ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácapital messuage‰Û¡ÌÝå» of 1553 is likely to have been surrounded by formal earthwork gardens. Although these will have been substantially damaged, some traces them may still be recoverable. Mr Everson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s studies of the earthworks of formal gardens created on the sites of former monastic sites have shown the potential interest in the symbolism established by these features (Everson 1996; Everson and Williamson 1998, 146-50).",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn around the boundary of the so called Malandry Closes, which were shown by Dr Cookson to be the boundary of the medieval precinct (Cookson 1843).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.56,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.56,

Heavy traffic along Broadgate-Lindum Road and Monks Road means that the area is bounded on three sides by busy roads which are a barrier to movement to and from the city centre. The site has seen educational use from the Victorian Period and the entire site now forms the campus of Lincoln College. These buildings have large footprints and are in a variety of architectural styles although unity comes from the repeated use of red brick and large windows. The line of Victorian buildings with gable ends facing on to Monks Road forms a building line which draws the eye into the area. Wider streets with flush paving, modern street furniture and little vehicular traffic encourage pedestrian movement through the area.

It was intended to provide a dedicated space for the city courts outside Stonebow (RAZ 11.64), which could consequently revert exclusively to the role of Council chamber. The building has austere neo-classical facades which lend authority to its business, although when new it was considered to resemble a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágentleman‰Û¡ÌÝå»s private house‰Û¡ÌÝå». This ambiguity requires further research; this was clearly thought to be an exceptional design in the early 19th century and it still seems so to us today. Clearly we should ask why such a design was chosen and relate this choice to contemporary thinking about the role of the judiciary in society - this was a building designed at the same time as the defeat of revolutionary France at Trafalgar. Inside, typically, the court rooms were primarily designed to impress miscreants with the full panoply of justice. It is important that detailed recording work accompanies repair and restoration work, as the interior survives in good condition, and can tell us something of the administration of justice in the early 19th century. Remains of the contemporary prison to the east (replaced in 1844-5) lie within another RAZ (11.67), but the relationship between prison and courtroom is clearly of fundamental importance and future research designs should integrate study of both structures.",Summary,"The RAZ is mapped following the boundary of the plot or park in which the Sessions House originally sat, as shown on the 1842 Padley map.

abcd83a5-62de-4c75-a2b4-3949eade0400,LARA RAZ AREA,,Valley Floor deposits,"This RAZ is intended to include the large areas of the valley floor where there are great deposits of water-born silts and peat. As in RAZ 5.8, these deposits constitute an important archaeological resource and, in addition to ecofactual information, they will contain important artefacts relevant to the Roman Military Era. In these areas environmental sampling should be aimed at understanding the lines of water courses, the identification of islands, the water conditions and, in particular, how the water conditions changed as the result of the construction of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáWigford‰Û¡ÌÝå» causeway. In the area to the east of the Stamp End causeway, it may be possible to deduce from changing environmental conditions whether the causeway was maintained in its Iron Age form, modified, or destroyed.",Summary,"The boundaries of this RAZ are marked, broadly speaking, by the modern 5m contour, which corresponds approximately to the boundary of the riparian peat and silts, although the boundary of permanently dry and periodically/permanently waterlogged ground in the Roman period lay below 3.5m OD. It is certain, however, that in this Era, streams and river channels of RAZ 6.7 were crossed by the Wigford causeway creating an informative zone of overlap between RAZs 6.2 and 6.7. The boundaries of the areas of wetland to the south-west of Wigford in the vicinity of Swanpool are less well understood, and there are almost certainly sand islands in amongst the peat here, which have yet to be mapped. The boundary of RAZ 6.7 probably includes the island known in the Middle Ages as Hartsholme. Because this island was the site of an interesting and apparently early religious foundation in the Medieval period (RAZ 9.61) there is a possibility that it might have played some role in ritualistic uses of the pool in earlier periods. It might be comparable, for example with the island discovered at HG72 (RAZ 6.3). Defining such islands should be regarded as a priority within bore-hole work in this RAZ. Subsequent investigation should be aimed at establishing whether any occupation is of ritualistic character and whether, like at HG72, it continues through the Roman conquest. Observations of podsolised soil show that Chaplin Street (CS73) was outside this RAZ, suggesting that the gap between the Wigford gravel spur and the Holmes Grain Warehouse island was narrow (no more than 180m). West of the Stamp End causeway the boundary is taken to run just to the south of Winn Street, running westwards to St Rumbold Street and Saltergate. To the north of Washingborough Road at the eastern city limit, the boundary runs immediately north of the railway embankment and is recognisable in the field by the character of the subsoil. Further west, the Cow Paddle is within the RAZ but the old and new cemeteries probably lie south of it. To the west of Canwick Road excavations at the football stadium showed that ditches and gullies of presumed Roman date were buried below undated silt deposits. This site therefore clearly lay close to the boundary of the RAZ. To the west of Ermine Street the boundary lay north of the present river/Brayford Pool but south of Newland and Carholme Road. The boundary to the south-west of the city must be located to the north of the later Roman pottery kilns at Swanpool.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.7,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.7,

ac359cc5-8ece-4785-93f1-88fa21f41396,LARA RAZ AREA,,Lower city defences,"We have no reason to doubt that the walls of the lower city were also substantially those of the Roman Era. Certainly this will have been the case during the Anglo-Scandinavian period, although any repair and enhancement of this period would be of the greatest interest if it could be identified. It is possible, however, that maintenance of the walls of the lower city was not a high priority for the inhabitants of the lower city in the Anglo-Scandinavian period. Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s discussion of the development of the waterfront (chapter 9a) makes it clear that there was 10th-century activity related to the port on both sides and the wall may have been no more than an inconvenience here. Furthermore, where excavated, it is clear that the south wall of the Roman city was a constraint on the development of the waterside and within a century or so it had been done away with. Research on this length of wall, therefore, should be focused on the date and manner of this abandonment. Was the wall breached by a sequence of private initiatives over an extended period of time, or was it rather overwhelmed by a single act of public policy? Our present understanding of the development of the Anglo-Scandinavian town suggests that these pressures of development were less acute on the west side of the lower city and it may be that the wall required less adaptation in this sector. Certainly little evidence was forthcoming for any major alterations to the wall after the end of the Roman period in the Park excavations (P70 - ed. Jones 1999, 262), but there was some evidence from further up the slope that the ditch was re-cut in the 11th century (Ibid. 253).In the cases of the lower city, however, we have a small amount of evidence that the walls were reconstructed and maintained during the High Medieval Era. First the city was granted murage on a number of occasions during the 13th and early 14th centuries (Turner 1971, appendix b). These grants, which allowed the city to raise money for their town wall, fall into three distinct groupings. The first comes in 1224-7, when the city might have been rectifying damage caused during the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáFair of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå» in 1217. A second phase of repair is indicated by three successive murage grants from 1253 to 1274, whilst an even more extended period of consolidation is marked by a sequence of grants, with gaps, between 1288 and 1371. We also have some excavated evidence for adaptation and alteration from excavations, and it was no doubt during the final phase of work indicated by the murage grants that the wing-walls were extended down to the water‰Û¡ÌÝå»s edge, and the two new terminal towers were constructed (chapter 9a). The final act in the re-edification of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s defences was the (partial) reconstruction in 1390 of Stonebow, the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s south gate (Stocker 1997b). The present structure is a complex one of several dates and any repair work here must be accompanied by appropriate archaeological recording, aimed at elucidating the structural sequence and the extent to which this gate was ever really defensive, as opposed to symbolic, in character. The buried remains of earlier gates will survive below and within the fabric of the standing building and any work here will have to be carried out in conjunction with an extensive recording project. Although the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáwing-walls‰Û¡ÌÝå» were clearly newly built, most of the work on the walls must have been repair and reconstruction. The evidence for such repairs comes mostly from the eastern wall in the vicinity of Greyfriars. Here Anglo-Saxon sculpture has been discovered, perhaps reused in the town wall in the 13th century (Everson and Stocker 1999, 197-8); here also alterations to the alignment of the wall were deduced during excavations (GLB94) and here there is documentary evidence for the blocking of a postern gate and for the Friar‰Û¡ÌÝå»s encroachment on the wall‰Û¡ÌÝå»s fabric (Martin 1935, 44-5). Dr Vince has already pointed out that a later-medieval doorway is visible in the Buck",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries are drawn to include both the wall itself and a strip of land 50 metres wide to include the whole of the ditch.

This is an important structure, because of the survival of some relevant early documents; but more than that, the kiln site is distinguished by its continuing into the 17th century, by which time it is called a brick yard (RAZ 10.40). The site offers exceptional evidence, then, for the development of this specialised industry over a period of at least 500 years and this makes it a site of great importance. Presumably it obtained its clay from diggings on South Common that can still be traced as earthworks, which only adds to the importance of the site. It is thought that the clay diggings might represent the exercise of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon rights‰Û¡ÌÝå» (RAZ 9.41.1) and this raises the intriguing possibility that the tile house was a common facility. This would certainly explain why it was owned by the City Council, and why it has been documented so thoroughly in City records (Cameron 1985, 158-9). Further research on the site should investigate the possibility that the kiln was operated as a common facility, even when leased out by the Council to private operators and institutions such as Thurgarton Priory, and should explore what differences such common ownership might have imposed on the layout and operation of the site. The tile house site is likely to preserve not just kilns but also the clay-mills, drying sheds and other ancillary buildings which have been so rarely investigated in previous excavations that have concentrated on the kilns themselves. A full Research Agenda for the tile industry is provided by Simcoe (1998).",Summary,"We know enough about the medieval topography of this part of the city to say that the kiln site, including its ancillary buildings, were located in a block of land bounded on the north-west by the churchyard and prebendal house of St Botolph (RAZ 9.60.12), on the west by St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Green (RAZ 9.20), on the east by the lane which lead down to Little Bargate, and on the south by the wall between the two Bargates (RAZ 9.51.5)",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.40.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.40.2,

Wallis Chapman and named after Thomas Cooper). Buried remains of this important early Baptist site will survive below ground, although the chapel was demolished in 1971-2. In 1818 a distinct sect of Calvinistic (or Particular) Baptists built themselves a separate chapel in Mint Lane, which has also been replaced, but this time by a new chapel on the same site (of 1870-1 to designs by architects Drury and Mortimer) with a small graveyard behind. The buried remains of the 1818 chapel will be of considerable interest, especially if they can be compared with the remains of the chapel in St Benedict's Square. Before 1887 a Baptist chapel had been opened on the north side of Monks Road to the east of the City School. The layout of Baptist chapels, incorporating the baptistery itself, tends to express the core beliefs of the sect. At St Benedict‰Û¡ÌÝå»s it is reported that the original baptistery was outside the chapel, in the bank of the river, but we need to know at what stage in the development of the sect it was brought indoors. Was this move anything to do with the formation of the Calvinistic group within the Baptist community? Similarly we might hope to find some indications of differences in belief and doctrine in the differing layouts of the two chapels. The small graveyard will contain an extremely interesting population as its members are likely to have represented a particular social group. The Baptists in Lincoln had a reputation for evangelism amongst the working classes and so this population will make an extremely interesting group in comparison with other dissenters‰Û¡ÌÝå» graveyards and with graveyards belonging to the Anglicans.

The practical effect of the Act was to turn a small number of citizens who had previously been farmers, probably living in Newport, into tenants of the City Council in newly established farms set amongst a patch-work of new fields where the open fields had been. Of these, the grandest was Lincoln Field Farm which had several yards, one to the west side of Ermine Street Ì´_ mile north of Newport and another east of Nettleham Road (locations marked on 1st edition O.S.). The original layout of these farm yards will represent a model of agricultural thinking in the first and second decades of the 19th century and this plan should be recovered and compared with model farms elsewhere in the county and country (RAZ 11.12; 11.13; 11.14; 11.15.2; Barnwell & Giles 1997). The present buildings on these sites should be recorded during the course of any alterations with the aim of understanding the changes introduced in a substantial ‰Û¡ÌÝÌánew‰Û¡ÌÝå» farm of the 19th century. Another large enclosure farm was built on the Burton Road in the vicinity of the modern Mill Row and is planned on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map. Similar research considerations apply as to Lincoln Field Farm, with the additional matter of interest that the farm included an important windmill, which may have continued to function after the farm had been swallowed up by houses. The research agenda for the mill itself will be that in RAZ 11.38 below, but we should also ask whether the farm and mill might not have belonged to the City Council itself, like others of the new farms, and if this was so did the new mill function as a City Council facility? It is possible that Stonefield House (RAZ 11.28) was integrated into the farming economy, as it seems to have an associated kennels and dairy (Herridge 1999, No.5258).These new farms should be contrasted with the farm behind the Turk‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Head at the south end of Newport (called Manor Farm in 1889). This looks like the base of one of the pre-enclosure farmers of Newport, who continued after enclosure to farm fields north of the city, but without the benefit of a new buildings in a new location. A new farm house was built after 1842, however, which still survives as part of No.1 Russell Court. As an example of a 19th-century rural building set within the town this is an interesting structure which should be recorded during the process of repairs and alterations. The plan and architectural details need to be set against examples from the rural county to see whether its urban location required significant modifications. A row of stone cottages, said to belong to the farm workers, still survives on the south side of Rasen Lane. Again, within the city, this is an important survival of an unusual class of building. They should be the subject of recording during repairs and alterations which should seek to compare the plans and architectural details here with those on the buildings of the urban working class (RAZ 11.25; 11.26). We need to know where the rural working class stood relative to their urban cousins in comparative living conditions. The archaeology of the post-enclosure fields themselves is likely to be rather coarse and uninformative on a small scale. Excavation may be a less effective technique of exploration here, but even so, soil analyses from widely scattered sites in the fields may provide useful information about relative fertility and, over time, the distribution patterns of pottery may give some indication about manuring.",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the whole area of the enclosed field system of Lincoln field, extending from Burton Road in the west to Greetwell Road in the south-east.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.17,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.17,

ade5f0a0-d415-41c8-9ce7-488a86ac9594,LARA RAZ AREA,,Racecourse Kiln and associated industrial zone,"On the north side of the river Till the (short-lived?) ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáRacecourse kiln‰Û¡ÌÝå» may have been founded to exploit similar natural resources to those in Swanpool and Boultham (RAZ 7.3); ie, parts of the fertile flat area of alluvium and hill-wash to the west of the city might also have been covered with woodland. Unlike the Swanpool/Boultham area, however, this land was of good quality, and although perhaps prone to flooding, one would expect that it would have been devoted to meadow (or even arable), rather than to industrial production. Could the kiln be a short-term indicator of a change in the agricultural regime in the immediate vicinity - with former meadow-land being abandoned to woodland, which was subsequently managed for industrial purposes? Or perhaps we should think that pottery production could have taken place alongside grazing? Farmer-potters are frequently met with in the Middle Ages and are likely to have existed in the Roman period too. But if pottery kilns could co-exist with grazing stock, that stock could not easily co-exist with active quarrying for clay. Consequently the source of clay for the Racecourse Kiln may have been more remote from the kilns than was the case in Swanpool/Boultham and it may be that these potters turned to the band of clay which outcrops in the cliff face immediately beneath the limestone. These questions can be approached using similar geo-prospecting techniques to those outlined under RAZ 7.3. Above the clay exposure in the cliff face is the Lincoln Limestone, which we know was exploited for building stone throughout the colonia period. Although no quarries of this date have yet been identified here, it is highly likely that such quarries existed, and it is not impossible that the 'Coreltauvian school' of mosaicists might have been based in this vicinity (Smith 1984, cf. also RAZ 7.5).We have no evidence at present for there having been any quayside area west of High Bridge in the Roman period. Whereas the equivalent areas east of the Bridge had a long sequence of development from the 1st to the 4th centuries (RAZ 7.8 below), to the west the naturally laid riparian deposits were only modified by occasional drainage channels. This understanding (should it proved to be confirmed by future work) is important, not just because it completes our understanding of an area of the Roman city, but also because it points clearly towards the non-existence of the Fossdyke during the Roman period. All of the sites investigated east of the Wigford causeway and south-east of the lower city tell a similar story - of a broad pool of slow-moving water, prone to floods, and with shorelines along which peat formed. Although the pool was undoubtedly exploited for fish (and, no doubt, for fowl also), and even though there are likely to have been small boats moored here, we have no evidence for any commercial exploitation, which must indicate that the riparian trade was exclusively to the east. It may have been the case that none but the smallest boats could get under the bridge where Ermine Street crossed the Witham.",Summary,"The boundaries of this RAZ are not easy to establish. At present the only feature known is the kiln itself. Potentially, however, further kiln sites, and perhaps clay diggings remain to be discovered in this large topographically defined zone. Consequently the south-west boundary of the RAZ is drawn along the 5m contour, the north-west boundary follows the city boundary whilst the north-east boundary follows a line drawn along the top of the cliff, to include the likely stone and clay quarries in the cliff face. The boundary with the settlement to the east will no doubt be mobile and an arbitrary line has been chosen intended to exclude the greatest extent of burials westwards.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.4.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.4.1,

ae0cce3d-7a13-4331-b5d3-b145fcfc7947,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,St. George's Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSt. George‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Character Area is a mainly residential area with some light industrial/commercial buildings that extends either side of Long Leys Road on the western side of the city. It is situated on the lower slope of the north escarpment and as a result has a gentle incline towards the east, which has strongly influenced views into and out of the area.The uses here have arisen because of its location on the edge of the city. Although separated from the built-up area of the city by open space including allotments, fields, parkland and common land, it is still close in terms of proximity. This urban fringe location, separated from the city and with large areas of land available was chosen for a hospital (for infectious diseases) and industries that required a large uptake of land.Although these uses have been retained to some extent, the Character Area has been steadily expanding as a residential area since the 1960s, probably due to the good access to both the city and the bypass, and the rural views it has retained of open fields and common land.Several elements of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s historical development are still visible in the current landscape. For example, the southern boundary of the Character Area marks the medieval route of Cliffgate, an important western access route into the city. The orientation of former fields is retained in the boundaries of some development plots such as the northern boundary of the Mitchel Drive development and the east/west boundary between properties along Albion Close and the Curtis industrial site. These fields date from when the area was enclosed by Act of Parliament during the Early Industrial Period. There are also earthworks associated with former brick pits in the rear plot of Travis Perkins yard. From the late 1840s bricks were produced at a number of sites within the Character Area, including the West Cliff and Albion brickworks. Two rows of terraces also survive that were probably associated with the brickworks, and buildings from the hospital built here in 1904. During the Modern Period, increasingly large residential developments were constructed on open land on and on part of the hospital site to the south and north of Long Leys Road respectively. Long Leys Road is a strong linear feature and all phases of development have a strong relationship to it. Buildings accessed directly off Long Leys Road generally face on to the road, creating an active frontage. Each development tends to have a single access road off Long Leys Road, sometimes with more minor internal roads leading from it. Houses within development units tend to face on to internal roads and the outer boundary of the site is lined with back gardens and the rear of properties. Because of this piecemeal development over an extended period of time, there is limited pedestrian access and no vehicular access between the different phases of development.The rural setting of the Character Area is a strong feature. The gentle gradient of the escarpment, combined with the strongly defined boundaries of the built-up area, mean that from many places there are views on to agricultural land, grassland and pasture. From the Character Area there are views to the north east on to the properties that line the ridge of the north escarpment and the undeveloped areas beneath. To the south and west there are views on to agricultural fields and West Common. To the south east the Cathedral is visible on the skyline with the city spreading down the hillside. Within the Character Area there are several surviving features of the former Victorian landscape including the hospital, the industrial area and two rows of terraced houses. The hospital complex contains many buildings set within extensive grounds with gardens and areas of car parking. Surviving Victorian elements include the main hospital building, Gervas House, a lodge and the boundary wall along Long Leys Road, all of which are constructed in red brick. Two rows of terraced houses survive from the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period and a single detached villa that belonged to the owner of the Albion brick works. The ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáIndustrial Terraces‰Û¡ÌÝå» have a painted render faÌÎå_ade, pitched slate roofs, very little decoration and mainly horizontal sliding sash windows. The Oakleigh Terrace houses were built two decades later, have exposed red brickwork and much higher levels of decoration. The light industrial/commercial units, on the site of the former brickworks, are positioned close to Long Leys Road to enable good access. Buildings are individual, low-level units of one-to-two storeys built with a steel frame and a variety of cladding materials including red brick and corrugated iron. They are positioned in the middle or rear of their plot, often with car parking or a yard to the front.Later residential developments, built in several distinct phases by different developers in the Post-War and Modern Periods, share many common characteristics. For example, the form and size of properties are generally similar within build units and use a limited number of standard building plans. They are mostly detached bungalows or two-storey houses positioned within their own plots with gardens to front and rear. Decorative elements include bay windows, rendered semi-circles above windows, key stones above windows, imitation stone sills and lintels, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáblocked-in‰Û¡ÌÝå» windows, and corbels beneath the eaves. Front doors are located in various positions on the front faÌÎå_ade, are mostly made from uPVC and often have glazed panels. Despite variation in the form and style of properties, many architectural components, such as windows, doors, and other fixtures and fittings remain identical throughout build units. Variations between developments include the way that building density in later phases tends to be higher, and properties tend to occupy comparably smaller plots than earlier houses in the Character Area. They are also positioned closer to the footway increasing the sense of enclosure along streets. Some of the 1960s properties along Long Leys Road have a greater degree of variation, suggesting that these properties may have been developed individually.Public/private boundaries are frequently indistinct, and often take the form of a border of low planting, low brick walls or wooden fencing, or a vague transition from grass/hard standing to the footway. To the rear boundaries between properties are generally wooden fences.There are a number of open space and natural elements within the Character Area including deep grass verges, some with mature tree planting. The main open space resource in the Character Area is private gardens. The close proximity of the Character Area to West Common also helps to make it a very green area. Several compacted earth footpaths have been laid out around the perimeter of different build units. These now have quite overgrown vegetation, contributing to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌárural‰Û¡ÌÝå» character of the area. In terms of vitality the area seems quite quiet during the day, although Long Leys Road has a fairly steady flow of traffic that gets heavier at peak times of the day for getting in and out of the city. Good access to both the city and the bypass has made the Character Area popular as a residential area. Its position amidst areas of undeveloped land has resulted in views over open space that gives it a semi-rural quality. Overall it is a transitional area between urban and rural that has characteristics of both the city and the country.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 51,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,13,

Of these the island known in the Middle Ages as Hartsholme is of particular interest to our understanding of the Roman topography of the Brayford. The site has been the subject of preliminary archaeological assessment (Hockley 1992) and this work has revealed occupation debris of the later Roman period. Because this island was the site of an interesting and apparently early religious foundation in the Medieval period (RAZ 9.61) there is a possibility that this settlement might have had more in common with the ritualistic uses seen on the island discovered at HG72, which subsequently became incorporated into the Wigford causeway (RAZ 9.21.1). This is potentially a fascinating site and future exploration of its archaeology must be designed to investigate its potential as a ritual site.",Summary,The boundaries of the RAZ are drawn to include the boundaries of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáisland‰Û¡ÌÝå» as defined in Hockley 1992.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.21.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.21.2,

afb85348-5266-4627-a175-e1dbadcc8e95,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Mary Magdalene,"The complex fabric of the medieval parish church of St Mary Magdalene (RAZ 9.60.32; 10.60.32) dates mostly from the reconstruction of 1882 (architect G.F. Bodley). It is an unusual design, very rich in its detail but constrained in its plan. Its architectural detail and fittings, therefore, will tell us most about the dramatic change in liturgical practise between the late 17th and the late 19th centuries. The burial population of the parish in the Industrial Era is not likely to be large, but, as the parish consisted mostly of houses in the western part of the close, those buried within the parish graveyard (down to the 1850s), south of the Minster nave are likely to be elite individuals. In 1826, however, pressure of space forced the parish to purchase an ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoverspill‰Û¡ÌÝå» cemetery south of Chapel Lane. Burials from both of these graveyards will be particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered deterioration in their circumstances. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city. Many graveyard memorials of the Industrial Era survive and it is important that the inscriptions they carry are recorded before they become illegible.",Summary,The RAZ including the church is derived from the 1st edition O.S. map.

b0501750-f56e-4f42-8aae-674ef8feedad,LARA RAZ AREA,,Woodlands and wood-pasture to the south-west,"As in previous Eras, the woodlands to the south-west of the city would have been an important economic resource for the city as well as for the parish of Boultham in which they lay. During the Industrial Era, however, charcoal burning and other more traditional industries will have given way to gravel digging (RAZ 11.41.7).Nevertheless, we do need to characterise the woodland management regime in the 18th and 19th centuries through extensive paleo-botanical sampling, particularly in the areas adjacent to wetlands. The woods, presumably pollarded or coppiced, were probably not only used as woodland pasture. They may also have produced several other important products which were important for the city: firewood, timber for construction, charcoal and bark for tanning. The last, in particular, would be particularly important, and it may be that the tanneries were located in the southern part of Wigford in order to be close to supplies of this important raw material (RAZ 10.34; 11.37). There is no real evidence that the bracken, which had been grown in Bracebridge during the prosperity of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s high medieval cloth industry, continued to be collected (RAZ 9.6). Even so, it would still be useful for bedding litter and household fuel, and it may even have continued in use as a mordant in the domestic scale cloth production in city. An effort to document the development of bracken cover in these woodland areas, therefore, may be usefully linked with activity in the city. Charcoal burning may have continued into the Industrial Era although the archaeological remains of such woodland industries are likely to be fragile, and will consist of a variety of hearths and other structures. Although unspectacular, if such features can be detected they will be of considerable interest. The impact of the arrival of the canals and the railways in the 1840s (bringing in coal) on the need for charcoal in the city must have been considerable and we should explore the activity‰Û¡ÌÝå»s decline.The northern edge of the woodland area is likely to have been used for peat cutting; indeed, the changing shapes of the various pools over time might be due to the impact of peat cutting. This industry is also little known in England, although peat must have played an important part in firing many domestic and industrial hearths. There are many sand pits and gravel quarries within the RAZ marked on the 1st edition O.S. map - see RAZ 11.41.7The farm known as Stone‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Place forms part of this RAZ (Herridge 1999, 5624). The farm may have only been established following the Lincoln West drainage scheme of 1804-16, although that proposal should be tested archaeologically. If it does represent a planted farm sited to capitalise on the newly-drained land to the north and north-west, it will be a valuable example within the city boundary of one of the new style of planned farms which became common in Lincolnshire following the improvements made at enclosure (eg, Barnwell and Giles 1997, esp. chapter 3). On the 1st edition O.S. it is shown as a substantial establishment, whose symmetrical layout appears to reveal systematic planning and it was evidently related to the large house of the same name (RAZ 11.34). The 1st edition O.S. map also indicates that the farm also contained a flight of two ponds held up by dams. No mill is shown by this date on the upper dam but the site of one should be suspected and should be looked for recorded and dated during future development work. On the lower dam the 1887 map shows a water-powered ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácorn-crushing mill‰Û¡ÌÝå» and a hydraulic ram which will merit detailed exploration and comparison with water mills elsewhere in the county and country. The presence of these dams and mill might suggest that the farm site pre-dates the 1804-16 drainage scheme and it may represent a small dispersed settlement unit of long standing. The farms called Hartsholme Farm, Oak Farm and Swanpool Farm north of Skellingthorpe Road seem to be mo",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the modern city boundary on the south and east. In the south-east, the Newark Road (Fosse Way) has been selected as a likely boundary between the woodland to the north and the river valley towards Bracebridge to the east, which is more likely to have been managed pasture or meadow land (RAZ 11.15.2). The northern boundary of the RAZ is drawn along the line of peat formation which marks the edge of the former wetland.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.12,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.12,

b08a0d81-6c26-40f8-a51b-8a55d8685fc6,LARA RAZ AREA,,Newport boundaries,"Because it was planned by Stukeley in 1722 (and indeed by other antiquarians - including both Marrat in 1817 and Padley in 1819), the Newport boundary ditch is the best known of the boundaries which surrounded some of the Lincoln suburbs. Stukeley was interested in this landscape feature primarily because he had already formed the view that it was Roman and that it surrounded the earthworks of the Roman city (then often called Old Lincoln). These earthworks were, however, of more recent date (they were the remains of the medieval suburb of Newport) and we have no reason to think that the ditch and bank are Roman either - indeed the earliest pottery from the excavations across the line of the north ditch in 1937 was 14th-century (Hill 1948, 169 & n). The bank and ditch were shown by Stukeley as major features and he also thought he could see the remains of two circular towers at the north-west and north-east angles. Furthermore there is a single reference to a murum domini regis in the parish of St John Newport (Hill 1948, 169 & n.), and Stukeley also seems to show walls on the insides of the ditches. The ditches, however, also represent the rear boundaries of properties extending back from Newport on Marrat's map of 1817 and we have to ask whether they were ever intended to be defensive. Clearly the settlement would require a permanent boundary dividing it from the fields and it may be that the ditch was primarily agricultural in intention, rather than defensive. Excavation of one of the two proposed angle towers should prove conclusive on this point, as the very existence of any such towers would suggest a military intention. The character of the wall would also be diagnostic - it should be possible to distinguish between boundary walls and defensive circuits in sections cut across the line of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádefences‰Û¡ÌÝå». Excavation, or building survey of the standing city wall, at the junction with the proposed defensive wall around Newport, should also be regarded as a priority, as such work could answer many of our questions about the Newport defences in a small-scale piece of work. If the ditch and wall shown by Stukeley did prove to be defensive, Newport would be a rare example in England of a defended suburban market place, and it is perhaps this point which makes it most likely that the boundary is agricultural rather than defensive. It is not clear why it would be desirable to defend a market place, especially such an elongated one, with such a great length of wall.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include the estimated width of the ditch, berm and proposed internal wall.

b0960fc5-1eed-48f9-87f3-74d01f2011e2,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Yarborough Road Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌYarborough Road Character Area lies to the west of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s historic core and spans almost the full height of the north escarpment slope. The Character Area is dominated by large-scale individually styled Late Victorian/Edwardian properties, as well as some contemporary smaller-scale terraced houses, which originally formed part of a middle-class suburb within easy reach of the city centre. Small contained areas of later infill and redevelopment dating to the Inter-War, Post-War and Modern Periods are also located within the area.The changing gradient of the escarpment slope strongly influences many elements of the urban form, such as the size of housing plots, accessibility, road layout, the aspect of buildings, and the rhythm of buildings up and down the escarpment slope.The Late Victorian/Edwardian townscape survives as a manifestation of a period of economic prosperity experienced by Lincoln, which resulted in the emergence of a middle class, around the turn of the 20th century. Larger-scale properties are highly individual in character, and are differentiated through variation in building form and scale as well as the incorporation of a variety of decorative features. Rows of terraced houses mostly comprise single, or a small number of, build units. Houses within build units are usually similar in form and decoration leading to short but coherent building lines and faÌÎå_ades. However, different build units of Late Victorian/Edwardian terraces vary considerably in form and decoration. Despite the varying scale and form of Late Victorian/Edwardian houses, properties have many common characteristics.Remaining properties in the area include a development of Post-War council houses, a modern residential development, and several individual detached houses dating from the Inter-War Period to the Modern Period.Much of the Character Area consists of open space, with large spacious gardens around houses alongside substantial areas of open public space within and bordering the Character Area. Private gardens have mature trees and vegetation, and create a suburban feeling of green space throughout much of the area. Buildings and the Character Area generally benefit from far reaching southerly views off the north escarpment, particularly from elevated areas. Views along streets up the escarpment slope are characterised by elevated and rising building faÌÎå_ades, whereas those down streets include descending patterns of rooftops and chimneys. In turn, buildings within the Character Area, notably the Ellis Mill, contribute to the western skyline of the city when approached from the west.Yarborough Road and The Avenue are important and heavily used roads in the Character Area, acting as part of an inner city bypass between western and northern parts of the city.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 62,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,23,

b1261bc9-5f25-4f6b-aecc-1f139eea19af,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Hykeham Road East Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌHykeham Road East Residential Character Area is a small suburban area lying approximately 5km south of Lincoln city centre, and is composed of two small residential developments including Grange Crescent, a Post-war [1946-1966 AD] housing estate in the south and Rivermead, a Modern [1967-2008 AD] residential development in the north. Many aspects of the townscape are strongly coherent across the whole Character Area, showing similar approaches towards the construction of housing in the latter half of the 20th century. Residential development has overwritten much of the former rural landscape, however some traces of earlier activity remain evident such as the High Medieval route of Hykeham Road and the alignments of field boundaries associated with the enclosure of land during the Early Industrial period.The vast majority of the area consists of residential housing arranged around a curvilinear pattern of cul-de-sacs. Both developments are accessed by single roads off the eastern side of Hykeham Road, and consequently there is poor connectivity to surrounding areas. Houses are generally 2/3 bays in width and are almost entirely detached 2 storey buildings or bungalows, with a handful of semi-detached houses and one row of five houses. The use of a wider range of architectural components and building materials to construct more decorative houses in the Rivermead development contrasts with the plainer Post-war houses to the south. However, the replication of building form and the finite palette of building materials used in volume house building has much in common with the approaches towards house building in the Post-war period.Public/private boundaries on Post-war properties often take the form of a border of low planting above low brick walls or waist high wooden fencing, but are frequently indistinct on Modern houses, with a vague transition from grass/hard standing to the footway. Large and often poorly delineated set backs, low building height, medium to high building density, and wide residential roads contribute to an open sense of enclosure for a suburb. Streets in the Post-war housing development, including Grange Crescent and cul-de-sacs off it, are bordered by thin grass verges and tall mature trees, which, alongside planting and hedges in gardens, creates a green and suburban feeling throughout much of the area.The Character Area also contains a small retail centre and Manor Leas School which is located in a large plot in the centre of the area, surrounded by car parking and grass playing fields. Open space is limited but includes verges along streets, the school playing field and the drain in the centre of the area. Views in the Character Area are restricted, partly as a result of the arrangement of houses which look inward into each development unit. However, there are wide open views of rural areas along the River Witham to the east of the Character Area.""",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 53,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,107,

b12f6e5e-5d77-4cc2-a6d5-d9fac9646829,LARA RAZ AREA,,Upper City defences,"The upper city defences remained essentially those of the Roman upper city throughout the Early Modern Era. We have no evidence at all that the walls were altered, although wall-walks and battlements will have needed repair and other maintenance if they were to continue to serve much purpose as either military or symbolic barriers. At present we have no real evidence for any such works; indeed by the end of the 18th century the circuit was marked only by parish boundaries running along property boundaries, earthworks and boundary stones. Surprisingly perhaps, the Civil War seems to have had little impact on the defensive circuit. It is possible that some efforts were made to re-edify the enclosure, probably in earthwork, and any such remains would be of great interest to military historians. Other than at the gates, where one might expect some sort of barrier defence (perhaps involving the reuse of the Roman and High Medieval masonry), the most likely points for earthworks of the Civil War period are at the north-east and north-west angles of the upper city, where there are still discrepancies in the scale of the earthworks, compared with the long sides. Further work in on the circuit of defences, therefore, should aim to explore any alterations or additions made to the defences during the Civil War and, perhaps, recover information about the social standing and material circumstances of the troops garrisoning the upper city. We should also be interested in the chronology of the removal of the defences. A length of the western rampart of the upper city is shown as levelled in views of the later 18th century and we should enquire as to the circumstances of such work. Was this rampart removed to provide material to fill the northern castle ditch during the reign of Charles I, for example?",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the known remains of the walls themselves, along with a zone 10m wide along the inside to include such things as internal staircases and towers, and the ditch on the outside.

b20455ed-e318-4d06-b71e-0ec2a97ba51d,LARA RAZ AREA,,Pottery production sites in the lower walled city,"The south-eastern part of the lower city was a pottery production area of considerable importance for the city and the surrounding countryside between the end of the 9th and the 11th centuries. Three kilns used to produce LKT (Lincoln Kiln Type ware) were found alongside Silver Street in the excavations in the Greyfriary insula (LIN73b - Miles et al. 1989). There remain, however, many other kilns to be discovered as the detailed study of the pottery from the Flaxengate site shows that the overwhelming majority of pottery used here between the end of the 9th century and c.1200 was produced in Lincoln kilns (Adams Gilmour et al. 1988, 172-3, 177-8; Young and Vince forthcoming). The sources of the pottery types known as LG, LSLS and LFS remain to be pinpointed. Paul Miles made the point that the establishment of the pottery industry on the eastern fringe of the core of the presumed earliest Anglo-Scandinavian settlement (around High Bridge and the waterside) would be logical. The prevailing wind would blow the smoke away from the occupied area, yet the settlement was near enough at hand to make supply easy. The site is also placed close to, and down-hill from, the outcrop of suitable clays for pottery making in the cliff above (no more than 100m away). Perhaps the most important point to make about this early industry is that it is within the lower city; clearly pressure on space within the walls during the late 9th and early 10th century was not great. Unfortunately, the excavations at Silver Street did not detect many significant structures to help in understanding the setting of the kilns. We cannot yet say whether these kilns were within a single property, which also included domestic accommodation, or whether this was more like a manufacturing facility set apart from occupation. The recovery of further kilns in the area is obviously of great importance, but we should also aim at setting the production site in its broader context, by searching for the ancillary buildings that constituted the larger site. In terms of local topographical development we also need to understand the chronological relationship between the Silver Street kilns and those discovered more recently along the foot of the cliff north of the Sessions House, just outside the walled city (RAZ 9.40.1). These kilns have been dated slightly later than the Silver Street kilns, but for much of the 10th century the two sites were in operation simultaneously. For much of their life, therefore, the Silver Street kilns might be viewed as south-western out-liers of an industry which was based further to the north-east, and their abandonment in the late 10th century might even represent a contraction of the industry towards its core territory, although Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s proposal that the expansion of population within the walled town pushed the kilns eastwards is probably to be preferred. Dr Vince has recently identified a second area of pottery production south-west of the former church of St John the Poor, east of modern Gibraltar Hill. This appears to be an early 13th-century kiln and may represent the idiosyncratic work of an immigrant potter. The relationship of this kiln to the earlier industry here remains to be explained and, in addition to exploring the products of the kiln, future work should also ask how pottery production came to be re-established in what must have been the centre of the urban area in the early 13th century. Not only that, as this area appears to have been part of the market area before the early 13th century (RAZ 9.22), was the pottery here established within an existing single or multiple tenement? - something which is only rarely seen in medieval towns. A research framework for kilns of this type has been published by Mellor (1994)",Summary,"The RAZ for the 10th-century production area is drawn to include the tenements extending back from the south side of Silver Street, although we have no evidence how far south the kilns extended. We know, however, that they did not extend further west as excavations on the western side of Free School lane failed to find any trace of pottery manufacture. The RAZ boundary for the area to the north of Clasketgate is drawn along the lines of the known medieval street-fronts of Flaxengate, Clasketgate and along the city wall to the east. To the north it is presumed that the potting tenement(s) cannot have been located further north than the southern boundary of the churchyard of St George (RAZ 9.60.40).

The club engaged its first professionals as early as 1886, and a grandstand was added in 1888 upon the club's entry into the Football Combination. Such features should be identified during the course of future work on the site and compared with the range of such early buildings nationally (see research agenda for this topic in Wood forthcoming). In 1895, however, the club moved to its present site east of Sincil Bank and a stadium was developed. Although not one of the very earliest such stadia, nevertheless any surviving fabric or remains below ground should be recorded during the process of repair and restoration, and features should be compared with those of other early stands. Differences between Lincoln and other comparable clubs will be meaningful, speaking of relative wealth and patronage in the city as well as of the team‰Û¡ÌÝå»s status within the contemporary game. It is unlikely that there will be any surviving remains of the many amateur pitches for football and for other sports which were established throughout the city during the Industrial Era, although it is conceivable that some remains of the 20 football and 11 cricket pitches laid out on West Common (and one cricket pitch on South Common) by the City Council by 1913 will be visible in early air-photographs.",Summary,The various RAZ elements are mapped following the boundaries depicted on various O.S. map editions and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.78,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.78,

b3fe185c-8c0b-4b46-b568-eed8e04f7d41,LARA RAZ AREA,,Wesleyan and Methodist Chapels,"There were many Wesleyan communities in Lincoln in the Industrial Era, and to make matters more complex, some were splinter-groups whilst others were re-amalgamations (Leavy 1969). The principal community was that said to have been founded by Wesley himself in the 1780s in a lumber room next to Gowts Bridge. Unfortunately this location is not sufficiently specific to establish a RAZ, but if the site could be located, it would be of considerable interest and its identification should be a matter of priority. The community had moved to Waterside South by the 1790s and a chapel was provided. This will be an important early chapel and any remains which can be located should be the subject of investigations. In particular it may be possible to recover the layout of the chapel and establish what differences it had compared with contemporary Anglican structures. The chapel was rebuilt in 1815 and closed in 1836. Its location may be marked by the dark rectangle to the east of the junction of Sincil Street and Waterside South on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1819 map and the RAZ is drawn on this assumption. The chapel was replaced by a large new chapel on Clasketgate (‰Û¡ÌÝÌáBig Wesley‰Û¡ÌÝå») built 1835-6 (architect W.A. Nicholson) and demolished in 1963. This chapel represents the epitome of mainstream Victorian Methodism and information about its layout and design details will be of considerable interest. It had a small graveyard to the east which will contain a population of considerable paleopathological interest, because of the limited chronology of burial and because the population were socially self-selecting. Results from here should be compared with results from Anglican graveyards and with those from other dissenting sects.A second community of mainstream Wesleyans also began life in St Peter-at-Gowts parish and by 1864 was prosperous enough to construct a chapel on Alfred Street. In 1875 they built a larger chapel on High Street named after Thomas Hannah (but also known as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáLittle Wesley‰Û¡ÌÝå»). The architects were Bellamy and Hardy; the chapel was demolished in 1965. The Alfred Street chapel subsequently became a Wesleyan school and, possibly in 1912, a Salvation Army Sunday School. A third community had begun life in 1831 in Newport and in 1842 they had built a chapel just inside Newport Arch at the north-east end of Chapel Lane. This site is of special interest because the original chapel is said to have belonged to a Baptist community (Hill 1974, 183) and so we might see the doctrinal distinctions between the two sects reflected in changes made to accommodate the Wesleyans. In 1879 this chapel was moved to its present site on Bailgate (architects Bellamy and Hardy), and it survives today. A fourth community had established itself in St Catherines, and, by 1881 they had established a chapel facing on to Colegrave Street, designed by Charles Bell. By 1887-8, they were able to erect a fine chapel in the gothic style facing on to Newark Road and also designed by Bell. Thereafter the former chapel became a school (RAZ 11.61). A fifth community was established in a chapel in Bracebridge by 1887 on the corner of Francis Street and Newark Road. By 1903 the Wesleyans had established mission chapels at Stamp End (at the southern end of Baggeholme Road), Burton Road (at the corner of Mount Street) and in Well Lane. Wesley himself was interested in chapel planning and recognised that the layout and fittings of the chapel were the embodiment of the specific doctrinal aspirations which distinguished the dissenters both from the pre-existing churches and from each other (Dolbey 1964). Consequently, the evidence for the layout of chapels as well as the changes which were made throughout their lives reflect both the original principles of Wesleyan dissent and the development of those principles through time. These are very interesting and important matters, which can often only be detected through detailed excavation and or building recording work undertaken duri",Summary,"The many RAZs include the plots on which the chapels stand as defined on the 1st, 2nd and subsequent editions of the O.S. map",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.96,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.96,

The first, built in 1786, requires further study in comparison with the very similar churches at St Paul and St Peter Eastgate (RAZ 11.91.8 & 11.91.1). The last church on the site was built in 1871 to designs by William Watkins and was one of the grandest of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s wholly Victorian church buildings. The layout of the church, with its raised chancel and other details, made its high-church origins clear, and future work might concentrate on how influential the design was within the city. The burial ground was only partly excavated and it continued in use until the 1850s. The surviving unexcavated burials from this graveyard will be particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered a deterioration in their circumstances. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city.",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ are those of the burial ground marked on the 1st edition O.S. map, which probably represent the burial ground of the medieval church.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.91.5,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.91.5,

This would have been, presumably a pool on the terrace at the foot of the cliff and above the river, fed by a spring in the Spring Hill area. The church has some claims to antiquity amongst the Lincoln parishes, as it lent its name to a prebend of the cathedral which Hill presumed was first established before 1147 (ed. Greenway 1977, 63). The church may have had some relationship with Beaumont Fee, the important urban estate which survived long enough to be well documented (Hill 1927-8; Gilmour and Roffe 1999) and this may suggest an origin as an estate church (especially if the Beaumont Fee manor was linked to the early episcopal estate at Willingthorpe and might therefore have been donated to the prebend under the terms of the establishment of the see). Although this is perhaps the most likely origin for the church, given the suggestion that some of the springs in the hillside had a pre-Christian ritual background (RAZs 5.4, 6.13, 7.19), it may be worth exploring the possibility that the church developed around a pre-Christian site. Unfortunately little else is known about the church or the parish, perhaps because it occupied the area of the city dominated by cloth manufacturing and so lost most of its population by the 14th century. The possibility that its parish was in severe decline from the 13th century does not mean, however, that it was without support; three chantries were established here between 1340 and 1351 (Venables 1887-8, 337) and assessing the archaeological remains of these institutions should be a priority in future work. This apparent contrast between the declining population of the parish and the support for the church amongst the elite is a matter of some interest and the exploration of the social class of the graveyard population could form the basis for an interesting study. Unfortunately the church site was used as an over-spill graveyard for St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish in the 19th century, but, with luck it will prove possible to separate the two burial populations.",Summary,"The site of the churchyard is known and the RAZ aims to include the whole of the known area. The north and west sides are defined by Park Street. The south boundary seems to have been the north boundary of the Meeting House property, whilst the eastern boundary was along the eastern side of the extension south of Beaumont Fee made in 1886.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.42,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.42,

b5bc92d7-6cf3-401a-a815-2ac5f672775b,LARA RAZ AREA,,Barrow fields north of Canwick,"In chapter 5a Jones and Stocker pointed out the importance of the single urn of early Bronze Age date which is reported to have been found ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáat Canwick‰Û¡ÌÝå». Although we have no precise information as to the find site, it is possible that this urn, which is of a distinctive funerary style (May 1976, 85), came from a barrow on the lower valley slopes below the modern village. Prior to 1974, the area known as The Cowpaddle, Canwick Oxpastures and Canwick Ings were all within the parish of Canwick, although they now fall partly within the city boundary. Finds made in this area, therefore, would have been described as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáfrom Canwick‰Û¡ÌÝå» parish until very recently. It is likely that it came from a member of the group of barrows, now appearing through the peat blanket in the valley bottom, which have been recorded in successive aerial photographs in recent years. Two of these monuments are said to be still visible as earthworks. This group lies right on the modern city boundary, but it is likely that they originally extended further westwards, and the presence of such barrows beneath the peat and alluvium should be expected as far west as the modern Canwick Road. This barrow group to the south of the Witham is mirrored by a much more widely-spaced scatter of more than ten barrows in the valley floor on the north side of the river, most of which lie outside the city boundary in Greetwell parish. In the recent study of causeways in the Witham Valley (Stocker and Everson 2003), it was suggested that, in five of the nine Prehistoric cases, the sites of the causeway terminals were previously occupied by barrow cemeteries. Furthermore, the causeways continued to mark these locations as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásacred‰Û¡ÌÝå» once the early Bronze Age barrows had become inundated by the rising water levels in the fens in the late Bronze Age. Given that we have argued that the northern areas of old Canwick parish contained the southern terminal of the Stamp End causeway, we clearly must investigate the possibility that there is an early Bronze Age cemetery concealed by the peat deposits in the valley bottom north of the modern village. This might be done initially by a targeted project aimed at producing profiles of the old land surface beneath the peat. If barrows do survive below the peat here, they will form a part of that important population in the fens of intact barrows that have survived in outstanding condition as the result of the late Bronze Age inundations (Coles and Hall 1994, 65ff). Similarly we should also investigate how far west the scatter of barrows on the north side of the river might have extended. It too may have extended as far west as the northern terminal of the causeway.",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ are all arbitrary. Although, of course, as yet we have little idea where the main channel or channels of the Witham were in the Bronze Age (RAZ 5.8), it seems that there were barrows both to its north and south. The southern and eastern boundaries are marked by the city limits whilst that to the west is drawn along the hypothetical line of the Jurassic Way. There is no reason, however, why barrows might not be located west of this line. To the north, the RAZ boundary has been drawn along the modern railway line which approximately follows the 5m contour.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,5.5,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,5.5,

The city ditch, the Werkdyke, was back-filled from the foot of the cliff southwards to the Witham, and Broadgate was laid out over its line, probably in the late 16th century. The width of this street may suggest that it was intended to serve as an additional market place from its inception. Despite this, there seems to be no documentary evidence that markets were held in Broadgate itself, and archaeological evidence (such as distinctive street-furniture or other features indicating areas reserved for stock) that the new street was used in this way would be very welcome. We must suspect that the street was used as part of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s livestock market because all of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s known livestock markets opened off it. At its northern end, the Beast Market, marked on the 1842 Padley map, was located on the site of St Rumbold's churchyard, extending over the probable line of the city ditch. The ancestry of this market is not known, and there is a 16th-century reference to St Rumbold in the Swine Market (pers. com. Alan Vince), which might suggest that this market originated in Monks Road to the south of the churchyard. The conversion/adaptation of the churchyard for use as a pig market will be apparent in the archaeological record and should be examined in future work both in the churchyard (RAZ 10.60.9) and in Monks Road to the south. Halfway down Broadgate, on the east side, the Pig Market was held in Unity Square in the 19th century, but there is no evidence that there was a market here before then. It would make sense, nevertheless, to propose that the swine market had moved from St Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churchyard to this location (perhaps to an open field on the site), sometime before the creation of Unity (or Jobber‰Û¡ÌÝå»s) Square before 1842 (Cameron 1985, 77). The date at which the square was created will be accessible through archaeological recording and, perhaps, it may be possible to deduce (through the discovery of street furniture etc) whether or not it was originally laid-out to accommodate a beast market. Below the square, or in the buildings around it, there may be some evidence to establish whether the site was used as a market before the square was created.The Sheep Market was well-established off the southern end of Broadgate in the space south of the Greyfriary by 1623 (Cameron, 1985, 37), but we have no information about its location at earlier dates. This space at the eastern end of Saltergate, and between the Greyfriary and the river was probably already the site of a long-standing market, however. Work on this Assessment has suggested that the rectangular space south of the Greyfriary, inside the wing-wall and down to the Witham, was the site of both the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s malt market (RAZ 9.23.2) and, subsequently or contemporaneously, the Staple (the wool market) (RAZ 9.3). The site identified in the 17th century as the sheep market occupied only the northern part of this space, but it may have owed its origin to the existence of these earlier commodity markets. Clearly we need to establish, through careful recording of buried deposits, whether this market was the descendant of these earlier markets, and at what date the sale of commodities here gave way to the sale of sheep. This transition is, obviously, a key economic indicator for the city, marking the final collapse of the High Medieval, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáinternational‰Û¡ÌÝå», economy and its replacement with the Early Modern, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌálocal‰Û¡ÌÝå», economy. We should also investigate the relationship of this change in market type to the disappearance of the city wall in this sector. The sheep market would benefit greatly from the superior access and increased ‰Û¡ÌÝÌástorage‰Û¡ÌÝå» area provided by the new Broadgate in the 16th century and it may be that the conversion of the market place to sheep was part of the same scheme as the laying out of Broadgate. If so it would involve the demolition, or pa",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the line of the city wall in the west and by the northern boundary of St Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churchyard in the north and north-east. Along the east side of Broadgate and Unity Square the RAZ includes not just the properties along the street front, but also the plots on which they sit. Changes in the plans of these buildings and other structural details will provide information regarding the development of the market in the street outside, and deposits from pits and dumps in the back yards will throw light on trading activities by the occupants of the houses.

b89fc2e7-02d7-4f21-95ba-aa860c2a9f81,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Botolph,"In our current state of knowledge, St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is one of the most important and interesting of the Lincoln parish churches. In its location the church is directly comparable with St John in Newport (RAZ 9.60.1) and St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Eastgate (RAZ 9.60.6); like them St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s evidently stood in the street within the large funnel-shaped market which forms Lower Wigford (RAZ 9.20). This implies that comparison of foundation dates and pattern of subsequent development with Holy Cross (RAZ 9.60.16 - at the other end of the market) will be particularly interesting. It seems likely from this that the foundation date of St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s might date the foundation of the Lower Wigford market. However, unlike St John Newport and St Leonard‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, there are some indications that St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s might be a church of greater importance and earlier date. The most striking of these indications are the reports, first documented by Holles between 1634 and 1642, that the church had a cruciform plan (ed. Cole 1911, 54), and cruciform plans (particularly in an urban context) are usually taken to indicate churches of more senior status. This cruciform church was also of great size - if the record that it was 123 feet long and 73 feet across the transept is accurate, it is of similar size to St Mary at Stow, and, furthermore, part of it was vaulted in stone. The church also gave its name to a prebend (ed. Greenway 1977, 54-5) and this too might suggest a relative seniority amongst others in the city. So although it seems likely that it became a member of the category of churches on market greens in the 11th century (when we suggest the Lower Wigford market was established), it is possible that St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s may have already been in existence. We should not forget, finally, that Leland recorded the 16th-century tradition that St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 7th-century monastery, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáIcanho‰Û¡ÌÝå», was at Lincoln - even though he located it at Monks‰Û¡ÌÝå» Abbey (RAZ 9.55.1) (ed. Toulmin Smith 1964, I, 30), so the occurrence of an important church dedicated to this saint is a matter of considerable interest. On the other hand it has been pointed out that dedications to St Botolph are sometimes sited at the entrances to cities (Cambridge, London etc.) and this reading of the dedication may suggest a more mundane origin for the church. Clearly, then, evidence for the date of foundation of a church here will be of great interest, especially if it proves that the church was the focus of a settlement which was swept away when the market place was created. Although the present church on the site dates primarily from 1721 and 1878, the fabric contains some reused masonry (especially in the tower) and works to the fabric must be carefully controlled and recorded. It is said that the present church stands further north in the churchyard than the medieval cruciform structure, and consequently any disturbances in the graveyard to the south should be designed to cater for structural as well as graveyard remains. Further south still, the house of the prebend of St Botolph is said to lie under 1-5 Spencer Street, which may have been constructed inside the original churchyard. This adds further potential interest to the site, not only offering a sealed graveyard population below the prebendal house, but also offering evidence for the level of care taken of buried remains during the construction of new secular buildings on former churchyards. The structural detail of the prebendal house itself will be of interest and will require detailed comparison both with other examples of clergy houses built on churchyards (for example at St John Wigford - RAZ 9.60.23 and St Mary-le-Wigford - RAZ 9.60.26) and with other contemporary housing forms in the city (RAZ 9.34).",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn to include the full presumed extent of the medieval graveyard, including the southern part which was later occupied by the prebendal house.

If this corner plot does represent the churchyard we should ask whether the church was not originally founded in the centre of Silver Street.

It is set within an area of terraced housing and civic buildings of the same period, and, in many places, is enclosed by tall trees. The section of grassed land in the north eastern corner of the area is a surviving trace of the pasture which would have covered most of the Monks Road area until the residential developments of the late Victorian period. Some current boundaries derive from pre-Victorian field boundaries and some are characterised by hawthorn hedging and tree planting. The Arboretum is located on the north escarpment with a relatively steep slope descending from Lindum Terrace. It is a well-used space, and in good condition following restoration work in 2001-3, and includes formal gardens, lawn areas, a terrace and an ornamental lake. Planting is a mixture of large grassed areas, mature and immature trees, shrubs and some annual bedding. The only two buildings in the Arboretum are the gate lodges although there are a number of other important structures including a bandstand and shelter. The Arboretum forms the main green space within the wider ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáMonks Road‰Û¡ÌÝå» area as well as the main public open space. It is also an important green space within the city as a whole. There are good views of the surrounding buildings and the south escarpment, as well as a view of the Cathedral which was incorporated in the design of the park.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 97,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,41,

b9f12fb2-4105-4d88-9d72-8b1380000e20,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Bunkers Hill Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌBunkers Hill is a large suburban area lying approximately 3km to the north east of Lincoln city centre, and includes Modern [1968-2009 AD] residential housing and a retail centre. The character of the townscape illustrates approaches towards the construction of large residential developments in the early 21st century.Housing developments have overwritten former agricultural land within the north-eastern fringes of the city, and few historic features remain observable in the current townscape. The western boundary of the Character Area broadly follows the former boundary between Greetwell Parish and the city, which may date to the Early Modern Era [1350-1750 AD]. A number of streets in the area follow the orientation of some former field boundaries associated with the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s enclosure by Act of Parliament. The Lincolnshire Poacher Public House on Wragby Road was formerly a farmhouse built around the time of parliamentary enclosure.Most of the area consists of very large urban blocks, with the remainder of the area divided into small-to-medium irregular-shaped urban blocks, many of which are defined by cycleways and/or footpaths. The overall grain of open space and buildings is coarser in the west of the Character Area than in the centre, south and east. Changes of building scale are a key characteristic of the Character Area, and often serve to differentiate particular parts of the area from others.Residential development is composed of a small number of build units, which vary from individual house builds to an expansive phased development. In the west, large detached apartment blocks, rows of flats and the Carlton Centre are arranged around a geometric pattern of curvilinear streets. Buildings have unclear plot boundaries and sit within a wider open landscaped area. Properties are two to four storeys in height and up to sixteen bays in width. Buildings are mostly built of brick with synthetic stone dressings, and incorporate some imitated ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátraditional‰Û¡ÌÝå» style features. Buildings face the street and have active faÌÎå_ades with medium solid-to-void ratios; however, there are few doors leading out on to the streets.Three-storey properties facing Carlton Boulevard and Venables Way are arranged in comparatively longer rows, which closely adhere to the profile of the street, often forming crescents or gateways to inner parts of the estate. The taller houses and stronger building line form strong and impermeable features along the southern extent of the build unit, and create a largely impermeable buffer between the larger squat apartment blocks and the smaller houses to the east.The remainder of the area consists of high-density residential housing arranged around an irregular and sinuous pattern of crescents, cul-de-sacs and closes. The majority of properties are part of a large phased build unit, and two large developments of affordable housing. There is a high density of housing throughout resulting in a high sense of enclosure for a suburb. Houses are two to three storeys in height and two to three bays in width and are mostly detached or semi-detached, although there are many short rows of between 4 and 9 properties. Houses are set back 2-5m from the footway with a hard standing or grassed verge, and frequently have indistinct public/private boundaries to the front. Building lines are mostly stepped, but often retain a common orientation parallel to the main direction of roads, forming broadly continuous building lines along streets.Properties face the road and are built at the front of their plots, and have small gardens to the rear. Houses are brick-built with regular doors and windows resulting in a medium solid-to-void ratio. Roofs are mostly gabled with their ridgelines running parallel to the road, and are roofed with flat synthetic rubber/plastic roof tiles, and some clay pantile.The affordable housing differs slightly from other housing as properties are laid out around loose grid pattern of streets. Buildings are generally three storeys in height and two bays in width and set close to, or at the back of, the footway, resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and strong continuous building lines. Apartment blocks and houses are generally plainer in decoration, are built of more similar materials and show less variation in form. Buildings have high solid-to-void ratios with small windows especially at ground floor level. Apartment blocks in the Pitcairn Avenue development are linked by covered external flights of stairs.The form and size of properties in the Character Area are generally similar within build units, which appear to be designed using a limited number of standard building plans. As a result, individual houses of the same form along streets are often differentiated through the incorporation of a varying number of decorative elements or simple changes in form. Decoration on houses includes a combination of imitated ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátraditional‰Û¡ÌÝå» features, including neo-vernacular, Victorian, and neo-classical style elements. Properties frequently have dormer windows or ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáblind dormers‰Û¡ÌÝå» set in varying positions on the front faÌÎå_ade.The varied character of houses in the Character Area illustrates a move by developers to design and construct individual properties, aimed at satisfying the desire of potential homeowners for a distinctive and personalised home. However, the use of a range of standard designs, details and materials within build units demonstrates the economies of scale of mass developments and their construction with a finite set of building materials.Detached or semi-detached properties frequently have single-storey garages to the side or integrated garages. Short rows of houses have communal blocks of three to four garages or open car parking areas in the centre of urban blocks. Many of the communal garage blocks are two storeys in height with a flat above.Vehicular movement in and out of the area is restricted to a single run of slightly larger through roads linking Carlton Boulevard and Hawthorn Way. With the exception of through roads there is no clear street hierarchy in the area, often making the townscape difficult to navigate. Many cul-de-sacs are surfaced with red block paving, serving to differentiate them from connecting roads. Pedestrian and cycle paths are well established in the Character Area, and link up to provide good access between residential areas and the retail development in the west.From the south of the Character Area there are good rural views of the south escarpment and the Witham valley to the west. There are also intermittent views of the west faÌÎå_ade of the Cathedral from the Carlton Centre.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 44,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,12,

bb109fc9-e271-44eb-8358-b02ccded226f,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Dunkirk Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe current townscape is heavily influenced by the former Sobraon Barracks site with a connected group of open spaces in the centre of the Character Area around a main avenue of mature trees which was the main axis of the parade ground. There is a semi-formal park to the east on the main axis of the former barracks from Burton Road to one of the main barracks buildings; this is now the site of Sobraon Heights. The cricket pitch and football ground to either side of the tree-lined avenue were also open spaces within the barracks. This key axis, with the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌákeep‰Û¡ÌÝå» building at the other end is now blocked by a fence.There was later development during the 20th century (mainly RAF housing) and early 21st-century development of houses and apartments on the former barracks site. The area now consists of three largely isolated housing areas, mainly of cul-de-sacs, though newer developments along Dunkirk Road and Cambrai Close provide more of a visual connection. There is a difference in scale and materials between different phases of development; the earlier houses are mainly semi-detached and rows of two storey houses in red/brown brick, some with external wooden panelling painted in pastel colours and generally have little or no decorative detailing on faÌÎå_ades. Later development in the area includes apartment blocks up to three storeys in red brick with rendered panels in bright colours and detached houses with ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáneoclassical‰Û¡ÌÝå» detailing.There is unclear permeability in some places, partly due to large number of cul-de-sacs and there is also limited vehicle movement within the Character Area - it is impossible to move north to south by vehicle. Vehicle access is very limited with only one road leading on to Burton Road and very limited pedestrian access out of the area ‰Û¡ÌÝÌÕ only along Dunkirk Road and Aisne Close. There are long eastern and southern boundaries to the area that are totally impermeable. There are smaller urban blocks within the Character Area in discrete areas to the north, south and east but there is one large block in the north-west quarter that prevents movement through to Burton Road. The buildings in the area have mainly active frontages although there are some inactive backs along Dunkirk Road.Dunkirk is a very quiet residential area except for the sports and social club which acts as a focal point for some social activity. The area has a varied sense of enclosure: it is good around the park at the centre of Sobraon Heights with buildings facing out on to the park; elsewhere there is a good sense of enclosure for a suburb, better in those areas where there is a continuous building line. There are some glimpses of the Cathedral and views of Trent View apartment block, which forms a landmark building, especially from Aisne Close.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 35,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,7,

Construction of such a causeway across the sacred bog would have been a very visible and easily understood demonstration of the power of the Roman gods over those of the defeated Iron Age peoples. The causeway is not just a fine piece of engineering; it should also be regarded, therefore, as a very deliberate statement of religious power.

Such evidence will be particularly valuable in those parts of the causeway in the central and northern parts of Wigford where the waterlogged conditions will ensure exceptionally good survival. Although the causeway became lined with secular properties in the Colonia Era (RAZ 7.11.5), we do not yet know how much (if any) of the military causeway was lined with buildings (there were, for example, none found at the St Marks site - SM76). Obviously, the discovery of buildings of the military period alongside, might suggest that the causeway‰Û¡ÌÝå»s sacred significance was restricted to the preliminary iconoclasm. A causeway which remained un-colonised until later on would tend to suggest the continuation of respect for the native beliefs, even if they were now expressed in a Romanised form (see RAZ 6.3)",Summary,"The east and west boundaries of the RAZ follow that of the known line of the Roman roads along the Wigford spur and causeway, at a distance of c.100m on either side. The northern boundary must be close to the later Stonebow, since waterlogged levels were observed below Saltergate. The southern boundary remains un-located. It will be marked by the point at which contemporary hard standing gave way to waterlogged ground in the vicinity of Cranwell Street. It must be close to King Street, as there is no evidence for waterlogging at Monson Street (M82).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.2,

Like the other markets, it seems that the shambles also moved further south (RAZ 10.22.9).. Its new location (first recorded in 1613?) was near the new poultry market, at the west end of the former churchyard of St Lawrence, on the corner of High Street and Clasketgate, in the northern part of High Street less than 200m south of its former site (LAO L1/3/2 f46). It would not have been re-located here prior to the Act of Union of Parishes of 1549, so it also may have been moved south in the 16th century. The physical layout of shambles buildings is often both distinctive and revealing, and, crucially, the structure of the buildings can give a clear indication of the quantity of meat being processed. Perhaps more so than other shop-types, late-medieval shambles can consist of rows of small narrow booths (as at York and Shepton Mallet, for example), and it may be that the narrow properties on the eastern side of the southern end of The Strait owe their origins to buildings of this type. Although these buildings appear comprehensively reconstructed, work on their fabric during alteration and repair might produce important information about this important aspect of the late-medieval townscape.",Summary,"The RAZ includes both the streets now known as the Strait and St Martin's Street as well as the properties in between - which may owe their origins to butchers' stalls.

bcdc56f5-7624-45f8-9b84-9c677b0afcba,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Andrew Wigford,"Compared with other churches which did not outlive the 16th century, St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is a relatively well documented structure, thanks to the survival of documentation surrounding the appeal against its demolition at the Reformation (Hill 1948, 166-7; HMC 1895, 45). This appeal was made on the grounds that the church was founded and maintained as a private chapel, and by the late medieval period, certainly, the parish was dominated by several major houses (St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáJohn of Gaunt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace‰Û¡ÌÝå» and St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hall - to name only those whose appearance is known to us). The investment of local families like the de Suttons, and important institutions like the Great Guild of St Mary and St Anne (based in St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall), should make the late medieval archaeology of St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s particularly interesting in comparison with other churches in Wigford and elsewhere, where we might think such elite investment was absent. We know, for example, of the presence of a notable chapel of St Anne at the church (possibly a detached structure - Hill 1948, 286). By the end of the medieval period, then, this church has quite a distinctive character and, probably, a complex liturgical layout. There were fewer than 10 parishioners in the parish in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287), but nevertheless the church continued to attract wealthy patronage and seems to have been more of an agglomeration of private chapels by the Reformation. Apart from detailing this elite character, we can use archaeological research to understand the ritual layout of a well-supported church with a variety of unusual responsibilities. It was not just the spiritual needs of the Great Guild which were undertaken here, but also a chantry of the Sutton was founded c.1414 (Hill 1948, 166) and it will be interesting to see if the chantry chapel has any direct connections with the Sutton‰Û¡ÌÝå»s house next door. Furthermore there was a recluse called Isabella resident here who benefited from a bequest in 1391 (Hill 1948, 166) and another in 1394 (ed. Gibbons 1888, 67); her presence should be detectable archaeologically. Archaeological evidence for such cells is rare and any information about this aspect of church use would be welcome. Attention should be paid not just to the layout of the church (and the anchorite‰Û¡ÌÝå»s place within it) but also to the anchorite‰Û¡ÌÝå»s living arrangements which may extend outside the church into the churchyard. It may have been the fact that the chapel did have all these ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásuperstitious‰Û¡ÌÝå» chantry chapels, and apparently little by way of parochial responsibilities, which singled it out for destruction by the City Council at the Reformation. Clearly there was no problem with the fabric of the church and it was not missing a sponsor, as the Suttons declared that they would continue to maintain it as a purely private chapel. It is possible, therefore, that the church was singled out for liquidation by the city for doctrinal reasons alone; they may have felt uneasy about the activities which went on there. In the event the church was offered to the Sutton family for Ì´å£53 in 1552 (HMC 1895, 46) and the church was being demolished by 1555 (HMC 1895, 48). Whether the Suttons saw the doctrinal error of their ways is unknown, but by 1555 the religious climate had changed completely and such private chapels in which the rituals of the old faith were followed were being re-founded. Even so we have no reason to believe that the church continued in use as a private chapel - although were archaeology to demonstrate that it did, this would be a very interesting discovery.",Summary,The churchyard plot is known precisely through the analysis of surviving leases and the RAZ includes the whole of the known site.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.19,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.19,

Landscape elements from the nineteenth century or earlier are still visible in the townscape and include the Pike Drain, the boundary of a pre-1886 gravel pit and a long footpath on the line of what is now Moorland Avenue. Several earlier field boundaries have had a strong influence on the current geometric street pattern. The housing in the Character Area is mainly two storey semi-detached houses and rows of four houses, mostly of red-brick with some harled. The housing has a consistent architectural style of fairly steep pantile roofs and deep eaves, small windows, arched alleyways and coarse moulded lintels which shows a connection with the Arts and Crafts style, seen in Lincoln in the nearby Swanpool Garden Suburb. There is a good sense of enclosure, for suburban streets, from the continuous building line, repeating building rhythms and regular lines of mature trees planted along the verges. The large, long urban blocks limit pedestrian permeability in many areas although there is good road access north and south via Moorland Avenue and Rookery Lane. There is a wide variation in the condition of the buildings from well maintained to some houses being boarded up. Some gardens have security fences at the rear and there is rubbish dumped in some gardens and on open ground.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 39,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,95,

be295be1-c169-48f0-a894-52099560f95f,LARA RAZ AREA,,The early fort,"Because of the postulated ritual significance of the pools and meres in the valley floor (RAZ 5.2, 5.8), any early military activity in this zone would have been of great sensitivity. Understood correctly, archaeological finds of the Roman military period should enable us to understand better the nature of the relationship between conquerors and conquered. The actions by the Roman army may have been provocative, at least initially, and we should not presume that the lack of documented hostility between the Corieltauvi and the Romans means that no such hostility existed. Indeed Martin Millet observed that the systematic lack of correspondence between the dates recorded in the documentary sources and the excavated remains of early military occupation on most sites in Britain probably indicates the difference between the initial campaign of conquest and the establishment of a force of occupation (1990, 44-5). Consequently, in territories like that of the Corieltauvi, where there is little evidence for any permanent occupation until the Neronian period, we might envisage an extended ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáconquest‰Û¡ÌÝå» phase followed by a relatively late ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoccupation‰Û¡ÌÝå», compared with other tribal territories in the south and east. Indeed Millet seems to include the Corieltauvi amongst the groups of tribes conquered by military action and not by capitulation (Ibid., 50). Mr Jones suggests that the first fortress may have been located within this RAZ (chapter 6a), and recovery of evidence to test this theory should be a high priority for any work within it. We should presume, however, that the imposition of such a military installation in the vicinity of a potent religious site would have been a very direct statement of conquest. Consequently, the relationship of any such fort to the pools themselves is a matter of great interest. Indeed the location of an initial fort here, rather than on the northern hilltop, may be better seen in relationship to the religious significance of the pool rather than to issues of military defence and supply.",Summary,"The western boundary of the RAZ will be formed by the approximate line of the modern 5m contour alongside the river; the northern by the estimated southern end of the seasonally flooded land. This is probably at King Street, but by that point the spur would be rather narrow. Furthermore, there is no sign of military levels at Monson Street (M82), and whilst there are some undated scoops and gullies at St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall (SMG82), there is no artefactual evidence for early military occupation. The south-western boundary is formed by the foot of the scarp to the south-west whilst the southern boundary will lie at the point where space becomes too confined for a fortress between the scarp-foot and the river (approximately the line of St Catherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Grove). To the east the boundary between RAZ 6.1 and RAZ 6.23 is notional. It is thought unlikely that any early fort will be located far from the lines of Ermine Street and The Fosse Way, which means in practice it is unlikely to be further east than Canwick Road.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.1,

Nevertheless, it is clear from Mr Jones‰Û¡ÌÝå» analysis that this area is the most likely location for a training and recreational complex including, perhaps, a parade ground (chapter 6a). Such structures are rare in Britain and any information about their character would be welcome. Particularly intriguing, perhaps, is the possibility that the ritual importance of the Lincoln area in the Iron Age might have been the stimulus for a well-developed ritual focus near the fortress, perhaps here to the east. Such a focus might contain a number of temples dedicated to military cults, but it may also have included theatres or amphitheatres, which were the settings for many of the most important of military ceremonials. If, exceptionally, the original legionary baths were not located inside the fortress, it is likely that they would be found in this general area.",Summary,"The western boundary of this RAZ is marked by the line of the fortress defences, which are known from excavation. The southern boundary is marked by the cliff edge. The curving eastern edge of this RAZ follows the western side of the known deep quarries in this area (RAZ 9.41.2). The quarries may well have intruded into the recreational/religious complex and they will have destroyed any remaining archaeology related to it. The northern boundary is notional, as the archaeology relating to any such complex will be indistinguishable from that alongside Nettleham Road (RAZ 6.16).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.14,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.14,

bf86b8f8-9800-47fb-9b09-5b4ca46ac25b,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Peter Eastgate,"The parish of St Peter, just outside the east gate of the upper city, evidently held on to its population in the later Middle Ages more successfully than many of its fellows, and it is not one of those where the subsidy collectors in 1428 reported an unsustainable parish. Indeed the Bucks‰Û¡ÌÝå» view of the church shows it to have a fully developed plan with late medieval fenestration and so, obviously, there was investment at this later period. Although it is somewhat earlier in date, some of that investment may have been represented by the continued presence in the church of the chantry of Roger son of Benedict, founded in 1293 (Venables 1887-8, 344; Hill 1948, 152) - which should be detectable archaeologically. St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s offers, then, the opportunity to explore the late medieval development of a Lincoln parish church in a manner which (whilst common in many cities) is relatively rare in Lincoln. The Reformation changes will, consequently, be well marked and St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s will probably provide one of the better examples of the conversion from the Old Religion in the city. Like St Nicholas (RAZ 10.60.2) and a number of other churches, St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s became involved in the Civil War and its abandonment was attributed to that cause by Browne Willis. According to Sympson (1906, 126) and Venables (1887-8, 344) it was dismantled to prevent it being used as a bastion from which to attack the upper city. Signs of deliberate dismantling may be detectable in the archaeological record, although one has to ask why, if it was dismantled to deny cover to an attacker, the church walls were left standing entire.",Summary,"The churchyard, which still survives, was bounded by properties to east and west and by the street to the south. In the archaeological discussion, Dr Vince has made a case that, at one time, Eastgate may have run on the north side of the church providing its northern boundary (chapter 9a).

bfef7cc5-c4d4-4971-8437-1f7e1b9f47ea,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Newland suburb,"Study of the housing in Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s western suburb offers important contrasts with housing in Butwerk. Whereas we know that Butwerk suburb had a complex development intimately related to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s success as a long-distance trading centre, Newland‰Û¡ÌÝå»s activity seems to have been more closely related to the internal life of the city. The roads passing through it seem to have led to the meadows along the River Till and to the Low Field, and the market seems to have been a later feature. Although, like in Butwerk, we might expect the earliest housing to have been concentrated around the three gates in the wall, it was presumably quite a small development served only by the single church of St Stephen. The church, however, was probably part of the manor of Willingthorpe and this might imply that some of these properties had the same unusual legal definition as some of the other properties around St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (see RAZ 9.32.1 and Hill 1948, 328-9). All of the other suburbs, except the unusual suburb at Westcastle, had a minimum of two churches and Butwerk, which is superficially similar to Newland, had six.It is highly likely that this RAZ will include the manor of Willingthorpe - for which a separate RAZ has been defined (RAZ 9.32.1). We can probably presume that the three roads leading away from the city attracted houses, perhaps spreading westwards in an orderly fashion, but it could equally have been a process where large new tenements were created on former agricultural land which were subsequently subdivided. Dr Vince wondered whether the belt of small rectilinear closes which were shown as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáold enclosure‰Û¡ÌÝå» on the Tithe Map west of the Willingthorpe manor curia, and west of the line of the proposed boundary ditch to the south, might represent deserted tofts rather than agricultural enclosures (chapter 9a). The validity of this theory can be tested by well-targeted excavation.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include the whole area from the top of the cliff to the north to the Brayford/Fossdyke and from the city walls in the east to the western edge of the enclosures marked on the 1803 enclosure map.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.31,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.31,

bffaf51c-de4f-4cff-b299-34f296f2baf1,LARA RAZ AREA,,Woodlands and wood pasture to the south west,"In the High Medieval Era, as in previous Eras, the woodlands to the south-west of the city were an important economic resource for the city as well as for the parish of Boultham in which they lay. The woods were very probably used for pannage throughout the period, as many local place-names indicate, and as the herds of pigs in adjacent parishes such as Swinderby show (Cole 1897-8; Darby 1952, 56-7). The archaeological remains of such use will be fugitive, and neither can we tell to what extent these pigs were owned or bred for consumption in the city. We do need, however, to characterise the woodland management through extensive sampling, particularly in the areas adjacent to wetlands. But the (presumably pollarded or coppiced) woods were not only useful as woodland pasture. They also produced several other products which were important for the city: firewood, timber for construction, charcoal and bark for tanning. The bark would be particularly important, and it may be that the tanneries were located in the southern part of Wigford in order to be close to supplies of this important raw material (RAZ 9.34). The fringes of the woodland on Boultham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s poor soils may also have been important for the cultivation of bracken. Although useful for bedding litter and household fuel, bracken was a crucial source of potash in the medieval period (Rackham 1986, 295), and potash would have been a vital raw ingredient in the dyeing process undertaken in Lincoln (Campbell 1971, 24). Although we can probably identify the archaeological remains of charcoal stands, it is not entirely clear how one should distinguish a medieval potash hearth (although detailed consideration has recently been given to such structures in Cumbria - Bowden 2000, 24-5), but it is likely that the burning would have taken place in or near the place of cultivation. The archaeological remains of these various woodland industries are likely to be fragile, and will consist of a variety of hearths and other structures. Although unspectacular, and if such features can be detected, they will be of considerable interest. The northern edge of the woodland area is likely to have been used for peat cutting; indeed, the changing shapes of the various pools over time might be due to its impact. This industry is also little known in England, although peat must have played an important part in firing many domestic and industrial hearths. Peat is known, for example, to have been used to fire the pottery kilns at Toynton All Saints (Cherry 1991b, 203). A sector of the land between west of the River Witham and the Fosse Way was in Hykeham parish.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the modern city boundary on the south and east. In the south-east, the Newark Road (Fosse Way) has been selected as a likely boundary between the woodland to the north and the river valley towards Bracebridge to the east, which is more likely to have been managed pasture or meadow land. The northern boundary of the RAZ is drawn along the line of peat formation which marks the edge of the former wetland (RAZ 9.7).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.6,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.6,

c02c02f0-c579-435b-ac43-0d6df93b6d81,LARA RAZ AREA,,Drill Hall Broadgate,"The great increase in volunteer military service in the second half of the 19th century, represented in Lincoln by the construction first of the Militia Barracks, and then of the Sobraon Barracks (RAZ 11.82, RAZ 11.83), also resulted in pressure for the provision of a drill hall in which the various militia companies could practise in wet weather. The Sessions House had been used in the past (Hill 1974, 77n), but in 1890 Joseph Ruston responded to public pressure and provided the funds for a purpose-built hall in Broadgate (the architect was Major F.H. Goddard). As a relatively unaltered, purpose-built, drill hall it has a number of unusual features of considerable interest, which require detailed recording during repair or alteration. Of these the specially constructed floor, of wooden blocks set in pitch over a concrete base, was specially designed to make a satisfactory sound when drilled on, whilst the acoustics were said to have been designed specifically to allow orders to heard clearly in any part of the hall. Of equal interest are the additional spaces provided behind the faÌÎå_ade and alongside the hall itself. These include an armoury with magazine, a gymnasium and a soup-kitchen as well as accommodation for both officers and NCOs, the internal fittings of which differ in a number of telling ways. Even more interesting will probably be the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáMorris tubes‰Û¡ÌÝå», which were installed below the northern annex and housed an indoor rifle range soundproofed to prevent disturbance to neighbours. The bellicose design of the Broadgate frontage expresses perfectly the militarism with which all classes were engaged in the 1880s and 90s, and which was to lead shortly to the Boer War, in which the Lincolnshire Regiment was deeply involved. The building requires recording during repair work in order to elucidate the original plan and to explain architectural details and fittings.",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the boundaries depicted on the 2nd edition O.S. map and includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.84.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.84.1,

The current townscape is also influenced by earlier elements such as the mainly medieval street pattern, itself influenced by the Roman Colonia and medieval walled lower city, and early 19th century buildings including Beaumont Manor and small terraced houses.The common characteristics of the terraced houses and buildings greatly influence the character. They include relatively narrow, two to three storey buildings in red Albion brick, gabled slate roofs, vertical wooden sliding sash windows including many canted ground floor or two storey bay windows, and shallow forecourts with low brick walls.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 38,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,47,

Both the initial building and its extension (of 1911) were designed by William Watkins (Burgess 1990, 41-2). As with the Upper School building further up the hill (RAZ 11.57), Watkins‰Û¡ÌÝå» important design expresses the democratic aspirations of the 1870 Education Act, with the additional interest in that it was designed to cater for females. Comparison with the almost contemporary Upper School may reveal interesting differences in the education of the sexes, but all comparisons will be most instructive. It is a building with an interesting and complex ground-plan and also many very fine details in terracotta and other materials which express the building‰Û¡ÌÝå»s original purpose. Detailed records need to be made of the fabric and of the architectural details before repair and alterations are undertaken.",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the site‰Û¡ÌÝå»s depiction on the 1907 O.S. map and it includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.58,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.58,

c191f605-5d7c-4d74-bca5-3630cda67a63,LARA RAZ AREA,,Long distance road routes,"The same three roads which had linked Lincoln to other cities and regions in the previous Era continued in use in the Industrial Era. The road which linked the city to London in the south arrived at the city boundary at Cross O‰Û¡ÌÝå»Cliff Hill, from where it headed down the steep slope towards the large open area of Swine Green. This road was part of the turnpike from Sleaford and Peterborough for which an Act was obtained in 1756 (Wright 1982, 37). The course of the turnpike road probably lay along the modern road, which is deeply cut into a hollow way at this point. Evidence for repair and neglect of the road might be helpful in indicating the varying weight of traffic over time, especially in comparison with similar results from Ermine Street north of the city and from the Fosse Way. In particular the work leading up to Macadamisation of the road surface will be of engineering interest and ought to be visible in sections across the road. The RAZ for this road includes the pinfold west of the road and near the top of the hill. This could have been used to impound strays on the South Common, but as it is not near the town gate we should explore the possibility that it was used overnight to fold animals driven along the main road. The long-distance route towards Newark and Nottingham, the Fosse Way, joined the modern city boundary at a point well outside the medieval city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s jurisdiction. The road was turnpiked in 1777 (Wright 1982, 37). Like the Ermine Street north and south of the city, the line of the medieval road continued in use, including the Witham crossing (RAZ 11.6.2), after which it headed north-eastwards to join Swine Green, again following the line of its high medieval predecessor along the modern line of Newark Road. It may be possible to say something about the weight of traffic carried by the road by gathering evidence for its neglect and repair during the Industrial Era, especially if such results are compared with similar information from Ermine Street north and south of the city. Again the results of Macadamisation may be visible in section and may be of technical or engineering interest.Ermine Street continued north of Lincoln to York (via Till Bridge Lane) and to Hull (via Glandford Bridge and Barton-on-Humber). This road was turnpiked in 1765 (Wright 1982, 35) and left the walled city at Newport Arch on the line of the modern road. It was presumably considerably narrower than the former market place here and the space between the edges of the new road and the former street line became colonised by new houses (RAZs 11.25, 11.26 & 11.28). In the vicinity of the roundabout at Yarborough Crescent, it crossed the defensive ditch that had previously surrounded the Newport suburb (RAZ 9.51.1). Road works here should be watched for evidence of both the defences themselves, which had been abandoned by this Era, and the bridge or embankment which presumably carried the road over them. Patterns of repair and neglect may be of some use in judging the levels of traffic on the road through time although such evidence will have to be deployed with care. Again the effects of Macadamisation may be visible in section and may be of technical engineering interest.To connect the new turnpike roads north and south of the city, the New Road, now known as Lindum Road, was built in 1786 (Cameron 1985, 79). The connection with Wragby Road, following the Close Wall for part of its route, followed rapidly and by the time of Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1819 map this through-route is more important than roads leading into the city. The structure of the large embankment for the New Road is of considerable interest from the technical point of view, especially as parts of the cliff which it ascends are notoriously unstable ground and the methods used to anchor the new structure securely will be of engineering interest. The embankment will have also required large quantities of imported rubble etc. and is likely to retain an important collecti",Summary,The RAZ includes the line of the road as depicted on the 1st edition O.S. map and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.6.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.6.1,

c1ad80db-e25d-4742-852d-e9ad9250e225,LARA RAZ AREA,,The Militia barracks,"Following the Militia Act of 1852, a new militia barracks was opened on Burton Road in 1857, at its junction with Long Leys Road. It was designed by the architect Henry Goddard and represents the opposite extreme from the old Depot (RAZ 11.81), being surrounded by a high wall with angle towers, castellations and many other pseudo-military details. The buildings are laid out along the curtain wall providing a drill square in the centre, and because the barracks were soon superseded in their main functions by the Sobraon Barracks (RAZ 11.83) they survive in remarkably original condition. The whole looks like a toy fort, which was, no doubt, the intention. Living and working conditions in the barracks will be accessible through archaeological work, both in recording the architectural details and fittings in the standing buildings during repair work and by excavation beneath the floors and courtyard. Results should be compared with equivalent results from The Depot and the considerable development represented should be viewed in the light of the development of the army as a whole in an age of imperialism. In some ways the bellicose building represents a generation which, following Waterloo, had only idealised ideas of the military life, whereas the Depot represented a much more realistic response to a military emergency. The cottages behind the barracks, in Mill Road (RAZ 11.26) are said to have been built as bandsmen‰Û¡ÌÝå»s cottages. A valuable research agenda for militia barracks nationally is provided in Douet 1998.",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the boundaries depicted on the 1st edition O.S. map editions and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.82,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.82,

With the exception of the riverside land taken up with port facilities (RAZ 10.2), the whole of the area between the top of the cliff and the water was given over to permanent pasture. Prior to the Dissolution almost all of it belonged to the monks of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey York and formed their estate of Monks Leas based on their small Priory of St Mary Magdalene (RAZ 9.55). In the 15th and 16th centuries a series of disputes with the citizens, corporately and individually, gives us a relatively clear idea of how this area was used (Hill 1948, 338-43). It is clear from several of these documents that, although the monks clearly owned the land eastwards from the eastern boundary ditch of Butwerk as far as the parish boundary with Greetwell, and apparently as far north as Greetwell Road, the citizens had always maintained their common rights to graze animals over most of the land at certain times of year. The long-running legal disputes are all aspects of the obvious conflict of interests the citizens' common rights would have created. Apart from disputes about access to the Blackdyke and other port facilities, on or adjoining York lands, there was much dispute about the various enclosures adjoining Butwerk. These closes (for example Calvecroft, Inland and Beridge Close) seem to have been the direct equivalents of the closes along the western side of Newland and the same range of questions applies to them. Precise dating for the establishment of these closes may be even more helpful than in Newland, however, because of the greater understanding permitted by the more plentiful survival of documents.This RAZ includes the whole of RAZ 10.41.2. It is likely that grazing took place on the cliff slope in amongst the spoil tips and other working of the cliff-side industries, although we may doubt whether most of these former industrial sites were used intensively at this period.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the Witham to the south (except for the riverside land taken up with port facilities (RAZ 10.2), the boundary ditch of Butwerk to the west (RAZ 10.51.2), the cliff top to the north and the city boundary to the east.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.8.5,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.8.5,

Not much seems to be known about this building, although it is likely to date from the second half of the 19th century when the threat posed by infectious disease was fully appreciated. It was the predecessor of St George‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hospital which was built on the northern side of West Common at the end of the century. Although little is known about these buildings, they are likely to be of considerable interest, even if surviving only as buried foundations. Research on the site in future might concentrate on how its plan reflects the specialised use for which it was intended and thus, the major pre-occupations of health care in the second half of the 19th century. It is possible that there will be interesting deposits containing medical rubbish.St George‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hospital continues in use today, but it retains several buildings of the Industrial Era. The most important of these was the Dawber Memorial Sanatorium of 1915 (perhaps by the architect H.G. Gamble). The building‰Û¡ÌÝå»s original plan will give a valuable insight into the state of medical thinking at the time of World War One, and advances in treatments can be judged both by comparison with results from the earlier isolation ward on the other side of West Common and with later buildings on the St George‰Û¡ÌÝå»s site.",Summary,"The various RAZ elements are mapped following the boundaries depicted on various O.S. map editions, and they include a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.52.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.52.3,

Although we may be able to guess at the approximate date of the foundation, there are few indications of who founded it or in what circumstances. The parish was quite a populous and wealthy one, including as it did the northern waterfront east of High Bridge and the suburb of Thorngate, and this had some impact on the architecture of the medieval church which is known from early views to have been a large and elaborately detailed building. The prosperity of the citizens might also be indicated by the foundation here of at least two chantries (for the Pinson family in 1324 and the Chesterfield family by 1352 - Venables 1887-8c, 25) and these are likely to have had some impact on liturgical layout. Similarly the graveyard population will also have contained elite burials, although it may have been dominated by families of lesser rank in this quayside environment. The graveyard continued in use until the 19th century, and, if dealt with as a single population, will permit a useful study of the development of the parish through 1000 years.",Summary,"The site of the medieval church is known and the churchyard is located in a key position relative to the city wall. When it was founded the churchyard may have been bounded by the wall to the south, but the wall seems to have been removed and replaced by buildings in the 11th century (RAZ 9.50.1) and subsequently the churchyard may have extended across the former line of the wall to front on to Saltergate.

c2ef26b4-d353-43ae-b08f-25d76d5b505c,LARA RAZ AREA,,Swine and beast Market,"At an unknown date in the Early Modern Era, the market for sheep and cattle had become established in what is now St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Square, but which was known as Sheep Square from 1623 (Cameron 1985, 37). It was part of an extended Early Modern market for sheep, pigs and cattle which ran from the former churchyard of St Rumbold in the north, down Broadgate to Sheep Square (RAZ 10.22.10). Evidence for pens and other stock management techniques will survive as buried features and from the growth and decline of these features over time we may be able to produce a profile for the numbers of sheep sold at the market. The period 1750-1850 saw the greatest development in animal breeding in Lincolnshire and we should be interested to see if techniques of animal management improved along with other aspects of agriculture (Hill 1966, 120-1). In what must be seen as part of the movement to improve the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s markets in the 1840s, all of these markets were moved from Sheep Square, Broadgate and Unity Square to four fields north of Monks Road in 1849, where the consolidated market remained until the 1970s (Hill 1974, 49). On the new site the layout of the stalls and pens will continue to be of interest. They will provide an understanding of the thinking in animal welfare at that moment, whilst the development of the site (including the construction of buildings) will reflect trends in husbandry through the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the northern part of the site an abattoir had been established by the end of the 19th century (perhaps to replace the shambles in Butchery Street/Clasketgate - RAZ 11.24.

This was the height of their popularity and the Citadel attracted the fourth largest congregation in the city on census day. From at least 1885 they had a 'barracks' in Portland Street, west of the junction with Cross Street. It is possible that they may have used industrial buildings which were on or close to the site, perhaps those of Burtt and Roper's Sawmills (Herridge 1999, No. 5253). If it is true that this group re-used industrial buildings as part of their first establishment, the conversion will be of great interest. It would certainly be consistent with their avowed intention to bring the gospel into the workspace, and the impact of the symbolism, in this city of fine architectural churches and chapels (both ancient and modern), would have been considerable. In 1912 the Army built their new Citadel at 106 High Street. The building still stands and should be recorded in the context of repairs and alterations. Such work might aim at understanding the original layout of the hall, which will provide an insight into the doctrinal position of this highly evangelistic movement. Of interest also is the layout of the ancillary chambers and their original functions. This group is well-known for its militancy and the equality with which men and women were treated, and the architectural feature of their citadels will help us to understand how that militancy and gender blindness was expressed.The Alfred Street Wesleyan chapel had become a Wesleyan school c.1870 and, possibly in 1912, a Salvation Army Sunday School (see RAZs 11.61 & 11.96). It is not clear whether there would have been a marked difference between two such establishments, but changes in the layout of the buildings might hint at differing educational principles and should be looked for in future work on the site.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to enclose the site of the citadel and its outbuildings using boundaries taken from modern O.S. maps.

Trial by battle, presumably, took place here from at least the early 13th century when the name first appears (Cameron 1985, 14-15), but it was also where other judicial sentences were carried out (thus the area's alternative name found in the 15th century - Pelours Place - i.e. the place of appeal - Cameron 1985, 32-3). It was certainly this use of the arena for judicial functions which meant that it was also used as a gallows. The archaeology of this unusual arena has not been properly explained despite extensive investigations in the 1980s (LH84, L 86), and any features which can be related to its judicial use will be of great value. As a place of execution, one might expect burials here, but, although many burials were found during excavations, they were all thought to belong to the adjacent church of St Bartholomew (RAZ 9.60.3). No evidence for the structure of the arena was produced from the excavations, which is surprising as Stukeley's‰Û¡ÌÝå» map of 1722 shows the battle place as a large rectangular earthwork. Given its prominent location on the crest of the cliff, with extensive views west and south, we cannot discount the possibility that this earthwork was a prehistoric feature (see for example RAZ 5.3) and this possibility must be tested in future work. Allen Brown thought that this earthwork might have been the siege castle for which orders were given in 1144 (1959), but there is little in favour of this proposition and it is likely, anyway, that the siege castle was never constructed (King 1983, 265).",Summary,"The RAZ is defined primarily by the area of extra-parochial jurisdiction shown on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map; (because of its judicial function this area was considered to be part of the Castle and thus extra-parochial). This corresponds to a space left unoccupied between the mills along the cliff edge (RAZ 9.43) and the western lip of castle west ditch (RAZ 9.48). To the north it is presumed that the earthwork was south of the domestic occupation habitation along the south side of Cliffgate, leading to the Westgate postern. It is possible, however, that the northern boundary originally lay to the north of this line and that the houses and St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church were encroachments on to the original area of the Battle Place earthwork. At earlier dates, if such an enclosure existed, it might have lain immediately south of the line of the earlier road leading to the Roman west gate.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.46,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.46,

c4868146-f0ab-4d33-a28a-e11f5764d91b,LARA RAZ AREA,,Elementary Schools,"Prior to the 1870 Education Act there had been a plethora of small schools teaching all ages of children, but so far as we know the great majority of these schools were held in private houses (Hill 1974, 140-6), and these probably do not justify individual RAZs. The most notable exception was the Wesleyan School, which was opened in 1860 on the site where some of its buildings still stand on Rosemary Lane. This is an important survival, not just because purpose-built schools built prior to the 1870 Act are relative uncommon, but also because the layout of the buildings and the architectural decoration tell a great deal about the aspirations of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s large Wesleyan community respecting the education of children. Consequently it is important that this site is thoroughly researched and recorded prior to any repairs or alterations. We know little of the Victoria Infant School in St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish and St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Infant School (Hill 1974, 142), but and it is unclear whether they were held in private houses or in purpose-built premises.Throughout the 19th century many chapels and churches opened Sunday Schools and these institutions were sometimes established in their own, purpose-built buildings. Any survivors of this class of school need to be compared in plan and architectural detail with the more regular schools, with the aim of establishing whether their institutional background had any impact on their buildings.In the years following the 1870 Act seven schools were opened or reconstituted in Lincoln (Hill 1974, 273-4). These new ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáNational Schools‰Û¡ÌÝå» were established, under the direction of the Church of England, in the parishes of St Peter Eastgate, St Swithin, St Mary-le-Wigford, St Peter Gowts and St Botolph. In the surviving remains, both above and below ground, of buildings put up on new sites expressly for the purpose, we have a wonderful resource for the understanding of the educational aspirations of the Victorian ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásocial educators‰Û¡ÌÝå». At Newland the Congregationalists converted their chapel into a school and similarly a Wesleyan chapel was to provide the new buildings for the new school in St Peter-at-Gowts parish. In these two cases, therefore, the interest in the surviving archaeological remains is focused more on the manner in which the pre-existing buildings were converted to fulfil their new (and frequently interdenominational) role. These buildings were manifestos of political and social theory which need to be looked at both functionally and symbolically. Each group of buildings also needs to be compared with its fellows in other parts of the city to identify differences which might speak of larger differences in social composition between the various city wards. A similar idealism almost certainly underlay the provision of the school at the very centre of the St Giles Estate which began life with the estate in the 1920s (Scott, 1989, 204-5). The whole estate (RAZ 11.30) is planned around this new facility and gives very concrete expression to the political aspiration of placing education at the centre of working class life. The original plan of the group of buildings and their decoration is also likely to speak of these issues and, consequently, recording work should be undertaken during repair and alteration works.",Summary,The many RAZ elements are mapped following the boundaries depicted on various O.S. map editions and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.61,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.61,

c49f6dd4-78db-4fc9-8227-abb587fe3c1a,LARA RAZ AREA,,Quarries in the cliff face east of the city,"As with the likely quarries to the south and north-west of the city, there is very little documentation for quarrying of the cliff face east of the city in the Early Modern Era. The quarries here were already very extensive, however, before c.1350 and Winnowsty Lane had already been truncated by them in the 1270s (RAZ 9.41.2). Substantial quarry faces are indicated immediately to the east of the modern Wragby Road as it broaches the top of the hill on Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1722, but these quarry faces, also, are likely to belong to exploitation in the High Medieval Era. In the Early Modern Era, future research work on the quarries between Wragby Road and Lindum Terrace needs to be aimed at documenting and understanding the slow-down in quarry activity which we should expect following the collapse of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economy in the early 14th century. After the completion of the Cathedral‰Û¡ÌÝå»s central tower, the only major building project here was the construction of the upper stages of the west towers (in the late 14th century) and after that, the Cathedral probably no longer required the great quantities of stone formerly supplied by these quarries. Building in the fine Lincoln freestone did not stop after c.1400, but the archaeological record in the city shows many fewer buildings using it. Quarrying techniques are unlikely to have changed during the long period of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economic decline, but working patterns within the quarry must have changed drastically. It is perhaps unlikely that there will have been any adit mining during this Era (as such mining is much more expensive and difficult than simply working open faces) but the existence of adits, explored using a remote TV camera in 1987-9 (WC 87), provides the opportunity to test this supposition. A research agenda for stone quarrying has recently been issued (LUAU 1996a). The evidence for lime-burning in this area was discussed in RAZ 9.41.2 and it is likely that, following its depopulation in the late Middle Ages, the northern part of the suburb of Butwerk would have housed limekilns. Archaeological evidence for such activity was provided by the limekiln debris from the northern part of the excavated area at Broadgate East (BE73), which indicated that the kiln was in operation during the mid-16th century. Furthermore Rosemary Lane was known as Lime Lane in the 17th century, although Cameron believes that it was named after a 15th-century family called Lyme (Cameron 1985, 78, 93). However, the unlocated kiln referred to in the mid-16th century as the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon‰Û¡ÌÝå» limekiln is perhaps less likely to be here than adjacent to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon‰Û¡ÌÝå» lands in RAZ 10.41.1 (Hill 1956, 83; Cameron 1985, 177). It is much more likely that this area contained private and commercial limekilns similar to those mentioned repeatedly in Dean and Chapter documentation and which clearly belonged to the Cathedral. These kilns seem to be mentioned first in 1561 (Cameron 1985, 177). By the 19th century an area of lime-burning (or former lime-burning) is indicated in and around the quarries between Greetwell Road and Wragby Road by the field-name Limefield. This was Dean and Chapter land and is the most likely site for the 16th- and 17th-century kilns reported in their ownership. Further work in this part of the RAZ should be aimed at establishing the date at which the works here were founded and at assessing where and how the stone used was obtained. It seems that these sites were usually leased by the Dean and Chapter to individuals who would presumably have run the kilns and the quarry faces which served them as private enterprise concerns. Although the technology of medieval lime-burning is quite well understood there is still much to be learnt - especially about how the lime-burning process was integrated into related industrial activities and how the accommodation of its workers was organised. A research agenda for this topic has recently been issued (LUAU 1996b). Further work in the RAZ should take",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn along the city wall in the west, to the west of which it is presumed that quarrying will have been restricted - though not necessarily prevented - by domestic development. The northern boundary is provided by the top of the cliff above the exposures. This line, of course, migrated northwards as the quarrying removed more and more stone and the RAZ boundary includes the maximum likely extent of this quarrying by the mid 18th century. By this date quarrying had certainly extended north of Greetwell Road, and it is shown extending north of Wragby Road in Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1722, where it will have shared (at its western end) a common boundary with the area of stone digging identified as RAZ 10.41.3. The southern boundary of the RAZ is less clear-cut, as operations integral to the quarries themselves (potting kilns, brick kilns, limekilns, iron smelting works and stone-working areas) are either known or suspected on the flatter land below the foot of the scarp. The most southerly evidence for such activity (from Broadgate East - BE73) provides a convenient point from which to extend the southern boundary eastwards until it meets the District boundary.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.41.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.41.2,

In this case the parish church of St Giles seems to have become appropriated by a hospital established for the care of sick and infirm members of the College of the Vicars Choral (RAZ 9.60.7). The hospital had become associated with the Vicars Choral before 1245-50 (ed Major 1958, 110 RA 2299), but it is possible that it had been founded with a wider constituency in mind - and archaeological investigation may throw some light on the founders' original intentions for the institution. The site of the chapel alongside Wragby Road is known, and fragments of stone from the ruins were reused in the present boundary walls and possibly in the fabric of the buildings presently occupying the site. Alterations to these buildings should be undertaken under archaeological supervision as, even if none of the present fabric is of medieval date, the masonry is of interest and importance in its own right. Apart from the chapel, the living arrangements within the hospital remain obscure. As this hospital is a rather specialised instruction, catering, apparently, solely for the Cathedral‰Û¡ÌÝå»s minor clergy, the layout of the buildings here is of considerable interest. It is possible that, like the parent body at Vicars Court, the hospital was planned around a quadrangle in collegiate style. It is presumed that the later-medieval chapel was on the site of the original parish church and the conversion of the building from parochial to collegiate duties will be of considerable interest. Like the remainder of the hospital the new chapel might have been arranged in ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácollegiate‰Û¡ÌÝå» fashion.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the presumed extent of the precinct, whose east west and south boundaries are known from early mapping, but whose northern boundary is a matter of speculation.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.58,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.58,

The sense of open space throughout the area given by the large areas of playing field and open grassed areas, buildings set back from the street in large plots and varied building line is a strong characteristic of this Character Area. The large areas of grass with some mature trees are another strong characteristic of the area. There is a townscape of large, mainly single-storey buildings set well back from the footway within large plots.Many areas are not overlooked, some areas are in poor condition and there are long stretches of security fencing. Yarborough Leisure Centre acts as a focal point for the area although the large urban block limits vehicle and pedestrian movement across the area. There is heavy traffic along Riseholme Road while the rest of the roads in the area are access roads. The area sees a lot of pedestrian activity, particularly on the playing fields and is connected to the wider city by its recreational uses.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 50,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,6,

c5a3f0e1-568f-40e3-ad83-c56b2a155988,LARA RAZ AREA,,Bracebridge village,"As at earlier dates, Bracebridge is of interest both as a settlement in its own right, and also as a settlement living under the shadow of the city to the north (RAZ 9.10; 10.10). In the Industrial Era, however, its subordination to the city extended to its being slowly submerged in the creep of suburbs southwards down the road to Newark. The process took quite a long time. Terraced houses lined Newark Road by 1886, occupying land which had been vacant in 1851 (Wright 1982, fig .20) and by 1905 almost all the gaps between and behind the street front had been filled down to the northern boundaries of Bracebridge Hall. These modest terraced houses would have been too remote from the city were it not for the tram system which established its Newark Road depot at Bracebridge in 1882 (RAZ 11.9). These houses should therefore date from the early 1880s and no earlier. This presumption should be checked archaeologically. It would be interesting to know what type of workers were drawn this far south of the city to live. Were these houses occupied, for example, by tram workers? If any of these modest houses are earlier in date than 1882, they must have been occupied by individuals with more specialised work, relating to the community at Bracebridge, which will be of interest in its own right. With the exception of the houses lining Newark Road, and the Vicarage and Manse to the east of the church, the settlement was virtually unoccupied until the start of estate building around and south of Bracebridge Hall after 1945. The water mills on the Witham, which had been a feature of the settlement in earlier Eras seem to have vanished before c.1800 and this may reflect the establishment, already by this date, of the revitalised milling industry in the city - especially around Brayford Pool. Similarly the location of the bridge (RAZ 11.6.2) does not seem to have been a magnet for development in this Era.",Summary,"The RAZ includes the area of the early modern settlement defined in RAZ 10.10, although much of this area seems to have been occupied by agricultural closes until the mid 20th century.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.19.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.19.1,

c6ac0b7d-9016-45bc-aa5c-9a701568423f,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Hartsholme Estate Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌHartsholme Estate Character Area is a public housing development located in the south west of the city, approximately 3km from the city centre. In addition to residential properties, the area includes several services including two schools and sports facilities. Residential housing and apartment blocks are constructed in a series of build units dating mainly to the Post-War Period, although several smaller areas of modern development exist. Buildings in the area were constructed on agricultural land lying between Hartsholme Park to the west and Boultham Hall Estate to the east. The orientation of several former field and estate boundaries are retained in the modern townscape. There is a medium-to-high density of buildings in the Character Area, which are arranged around a curvilinear network of circular avenues and drives with short cul-de-sacs and closes located off them. Houses face the road and have doors and windows looking out on to the street or communal greens, creating a feeling of activity and security throughout much of the area. Regular and well-connected roads divide the area up into small urban blocks, which are occasionally larger around services and recreation areas. A small commercial area, which is the only public amenity centre, is located near the middle of the Character Area.The majority of build units in the area were constructed in a single development phase during the Post-War Period. Houses and apartment blocks within each build unit frequently incorporate Modernist features, as well as some retrospective features more typical of housing in the Inter-War Period.Houses within the largest build unit in the area share many common characteristics, but are differentiated with various decorative features, small changes in form, and their layout in relation to the street. Properties are highly similar in scale, being two storeys in height and two bays in width and are constructed of brick with concrete dressings. Houses are set back 5-7m from the street, with small forecourts rather than driveways. Based on small variations in their form and decoration buildings in the area can be divided into a number of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátypes‰Û¡ÌÝå». Individual building types can be specific to a part of the Character Area or can be repeated along several streets. One retrospective building type is used to form terminating buildings at the end of several streets or footpaths. There are several different developments of apartment blocks within the Character Area, which are contemporary with the initial development of housing during the Post-War Period. The apartment blocks vary in scale, decoration and form; however, in broad terms the buildings echo some of the Modernist and neo-vernacular characteristics seen in the main Post-War build unit.Modern developments within the area include a large apartment block and two cul-de-sac housing developments. Compared to earlier Post-War housing, properties are of a similar scale, but are plainer in style, and have dedicated parking areas to the front.Open space in the Character Area is mostly composed of streets, private gardens and large communal grassed areas or playing fields The Character Area has strong boundaries on all sides and consequently vehicular access in and out of the area is entirely restricted to Skellingthorpe Road. Pedestrian access is comparatively better, with some connections with Swanholme Lakes to the south and west.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 22,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,89,

c6bbed51-bdb6-468c-ab70-324048c78375,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Witham to High Street Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌWitham to High Street Character Area is located at the bottom of the Witham Valley, and has strongly defined boundaries including Sincil Dyke to the south, the River Witham to the west, and the rear of High Street properties to the east. The townscape is a product of industrial and residential development from the mid-18th century onwards. The varied size and shape of development plots in the area is a result of comprehensive development and re-development of discrete medium/large parcels of land, the boundaries of which frequently incorporate a former medieval burgage system of land division. A high building density exists throughout, and consists of residential buildings, with mainly continuous rows of Late Victorian/Edwardian terraces interspersed with areas of medium/large public and private apartment blocks and housing dating from the Post-War and Modern Periods.Roads in the Character Area mainly date from the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period and run east/west off High Street, frequently following the orientation of former medieval burgage plots. Urban blocks are small to medium in size, many of which occupy the full width of land between the River Witham and High Street. Blocks often extend along impermeable features such as Sincil Dyke and the River Witham.The Character Area is well connected to the wider city via High Street, and linked to the west of the city via Boultham Avenue and Dixon Street. However, permeability in a north/south direction is poor within the Character Area, with few connecting north/south roads. Pedestrian access is marginally better, although many footways are improvised.There is considerable variation in building style and construction between Post-War/Modern and Late Victorian/Edwardian houses; however, buildings in the area have some common elements. Frontages have high solid-to-void ratios, and appear active with regular windows and doors overlooking the street. Buildings are built of small-scale materials, the majority in brick.Continuous blocks of Late Victorian/Edwardian terraced houses are fundamental components of the townscape. Terraced houses occupy the full width of narrow plots, with their short sides aligned parallel to the road or watercourses. To the rear, terraces extend back, usually at single-storey height across half the width of their plots. Houses are built of Albion brick, and are broadly coherent in scale, form and construction, being mainly of two-bay width, set at the back of the footway or with small forecourts and canted/rectangular bay windows. Smaller-scale variations in the decoration, form and construction of terraces emphasise their individuality and prominence. Broadly, there is an observable pattern in these small-scale variations, with houses in the north of the Character Area and near to High Street and the River Witham being comparatively more decorative and larger in scale. Properties are generally well maintained, although many original features such as doors, windows and rainwater goods have been replaced using modern materials. The form and style of Post-War/Modern housing vary between developments; however, within individual estates and areas of infill/redevelopment, buildings are coherent in form, with the exception of more varied developments around Riverside Drive in the north of the Character Area. Post-War/Modern housing is usually arranged in stepped building lines of detached blocks of apartments, houses or bungalows, roughly orientated parallel to a curvilinear street pattern. Properties and blocks vary in height and width, and are generally set back from the carriageway, occupying the centre of their plots, with indistinct public/private boundaries to the front.The Character Area is quiet, and generally unaffected by noise on High Street. Public or private open space is infrequent, and generally limited to lawned areas around public apartment blocks, and an area of allotments. Tree and vegetation cover is sparse, and is found within private gardens, allotments and along the banks of waterways including the River Witham, Sincil Dyke and the Great Gowt.The Character Area incorporates two former mills on Princess Street, one of which, Crown Mill, is a key landmark feature. Both buildings were converted to apartments in the late 20th century.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 12,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,75,

c71a8338-5581-4e91-bbe3-a0388e9a1232,LARA RAZ AREA,,Boundary of Lower Wigford (the Sincil Dyke),"Our new understanding of the development of the suburb of Wigford (RAZ 9.20, 9.33, 9.34, 9.51.4) has allowed Dr Vince to suggest that the line of the present Sincil Dyke from Nichorpool (where it is joined by Great Gowt) south and west to the point where it rejoins the Witham, is a new structure of the 11th century. The new dyke bisected the former market place of Lower Wigford (RAZ 9.20) and created a new southern boundary of the city. We need to test the validity of this major theory regarding the development of southern Wigford and this would be best done in long sections across the dyke at appropriate points. Although it is considered less likely that this dyke originated in a natural water course, because of the way it cuts through the earlier market place, as with Great Gowt, Sincil Dyke offers an important resource for paleo-environmental archaeology. However, this importance lies not so much in its modern channel (which has been repeatedly scoured) but in the deposits behind the present dyke walls. These deposits are consequently included in the RAZ. It is possible that such important deposits would be encountered during repair and maintenance work on the dyke and it is important that such work is done under archaeological supervision. It is likely that there will be structural timbers surviving from earlier water control features at the south-western corner of the dyke. These should be recorded in situ and then sampled for dendrochronological dating. In contrast to the other suburb boundaries, we are clear that this final boundary of Lower Wigford was fortified in the 12th and 13th centuries. The sites of Great and Little Bargate are known and both are important structures in their own right. Great Bargate seems to have been a tall tower gate, very similar to Newland gate and probably of the same late 13th- or early 14th-century date. It might be thought likely, however, that there was a gate on this major roadway before that date, possibly from the 11th century, when the boundary was probably created. Little Bargate, on the other hand, was a much more complex structure. Topographical views prior to its demolition in 1826 show that it had drum towers to either side of the gate-hall with a chamber over, and a stone bridge. It remains unclear why this gate should have been selected for such imposing treatment, since it was convenient only for travellers taking the route to Canwick and the lower Witham valley following the construction of the Malandry (RAZ 9.56).The sites of both gates are known precisely and both should be investigated and recorded in detail. It may be that standing fabric of Little Bargate still survives in the building on the site and careful building recording is necessary during development work here. The structure of Great Bargate will survive below the modern road and should be investigated in association with any road works in this area. Both gatehouses were fronted by bridges, both of stone and both apparently contemporary with the gatehouses adjacent. The abutments of these bridges are likely to survive and should be investigated during works to the banks of the dyke and work associated with the modern bridge at Great Bargate. Documentary and topographical sources make it quite clear that there was a wall, and perhaps a rampart as well inside the Sincil Dyke, at least between the Bargates, although this was not discovered in excavations at Knight‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Place (KP92) which were conducted with this enquiry in mind. A wall north of East Bargate and west of the Dyke is referred to as the Town Wall in a lease as late as 1722 (ed. Birch 1906, 32 No.178).",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include a 20m strip either side of the dyke, to include wet deposits which are important for understanding the dyke‰Û¡ÌÝå»s early construction and fill and for paleo-botanical samples. Between Great and Little Bargates, the RAZ boundary is expanded to the north to include both the known sites of the Great and Little Bargates, the bridges in front of them and the presumed line of the defensive wall between the two gates mentioned in documentary sources.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.51.5,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.51.5,

We should explore the possibility that there were no ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» houses at all in the upper city in the Colonia Era. In such a model, all inhabitants of the few grand houses of this date for which we have evidence (mostly through the reported presence of mosaics) could have occupied this prestigious ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» accommodation by right of their having a function in the politico-religious community centred around the Forum. There is no reason to doubt Mr Jones‰Û¡ÌÝå» view that, in Lindum as elsewhere, the finest houses belonging to the uppermost levels of the citizenry were closest to the Forum. The question we might address is whether such citizens held these houses as ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» property, or by virtue of the positions they occupied in the government of the town, province or army. In the upper city, then, the crucial question will be, did such houses pass from these ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» uses into ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» use between the 2nd and 4th centuries? Furthermore we will also be greatly interested in evidence which suggests that the arrival of the new provincial government in the 4th century may have reversed any such transition or, conversely, encouraged it. If the elite of the 2nd and 3rd centuries were based in rural villas, as is usually thought (e.g. Millett 1990, 94), then the Lincoln houses will have been only occupied seasonally or intermittently and this patterned occupation may be detectable archaeologically, as should any change in the character of occupation in the 4th century compared with what went before. At present we do not have sufficiently coherent information about any one single house in the upper city to make judgements of this type. This might mean that reliance on small-scale, developer-funded, work alone will not be effective and that carefully targeted research excavation on a single property might be required. The intimate connections between the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» life of villa owners in the countryside and their ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» life in the towns, means that it will be particularly valuable to compare and contrast any elite houses within Lincoln and any of the surrounding villas, outside the city boundary. Unfortunately we have to doubt whether the Greetwell ‰Û¡ÌÝÌávilla‰Û¡ÌÝå» represents a site of this type (RAZ 7.23 below)",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the walls of the upper city.

c8568697-f68a-4720-807f-d927726ac1ae,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,James Street and East Bight Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌFor somewhere so close to the Castle and Cathedral area, the James Street and East Bight Character Area is surprisingly quiet and secluded. It is situated at the top of the north escarpment, directly north of the Cathedral, and as a result, many of the earlier buildings have religious associations. It is made up of a number of detached properties built in several different phases of development that are all accessed off the two narrow roads through the area, James Street and East Bight. The Character Area is enclosed on all sides by the rear of properties along the more major roads of Bailgate to the west, Church Lane to the north, Northgate to the east and Eastgate to the south. This, combined with the narrowness of the roads providing access into and through the area, means that it has remained private and quite detached from neighbouring areas. The two roads have very high boundaries, part of which are surviving sections of earlier structures such as the Close Wall and garden walls built in the High Medieval Era [850-1350]. The roads and several of the properties have survived from this time and as a result, the Character Area has retained a considerable element of its medieval landscape. The high boundaries along the roads conceal the properties behind which are often seen only as glimpses through railings and gates. This creates a high sense of enclosure and privacy in the Character Area.A surviving section of Roman wall in the north of the Character Area and its location adjacent to the Roman east gate are evidence that it once formed part of the north-east corner of the Roman walled City. In addition to the laying out of the roads and the construction of the Close Wall, several properties were built in the south of the Character Area during the High Medieval Era, including Deloraine Court, 17-18 James Street and 12-13 Eastgate. These properties had large gardens extending into the north of the Character Area, which was less accessible for housing. This also explains why the area between the Roman wall and East Bight remained undeveloped until much later.With the exception of 1-3 James Street, very little changed in the Character Area between the High Medieval Era and the Post-War and Modern Periods when a large number of infill developments were built in the north of the Character Area, including in the gardens of some of the large medieval properties. Only the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s House has retained its original grounds. Properties built in the High Medieval Era have been retained in varying degrees within Deloraine Court, 17 and 18 James Street, and 12-13 Eastgate. These buildings show many phases of development, are generally built in rubble or stone, have a variety of plain tile and pantile roofs, and have decorative features such as ashlar dressings and rendered coped parapets. The only other property constructed in stone in the Character Area is 5 East Bight which was originally the stables for Cottesford Place (now replaced by numbers 1-4 Cottesford Place) in the High Medieval Era and was converted into a house in the Early Industrial Period [1750-1845 AD]. Part of the former Close Wall has been incorporated into the northern wall of this property.Numbers 1-3 James Street are quite different from earlier properties in the area as they are constructed in brick, are directly adjacent to each other and are positioned at the back of the footway. 1 James Street in particular has a number of decorative features to make the most of its position on a corner plot, such as a canted bay window, three-storey rounded bay window and panelled door beneath a cornice with a patterned tile frieze.The remaining properties in the Character Area are infill developments from the Post-War [1946-1966 AD] and Modern [1967-2009] Periods. These properties are detached, one to two storeys in height, positioned in the middle of their plot, set in extensive grounds often with driveways to the front, and are concealed from view by high boundary fences and walls along both James Street and East Bight. Trees and greenery are also strong features of the Character Area. There are many places where mature hedges and trees can be glimpsed in the grounds of properties or overhanging the boundaries along the roads.The area is very quiet in terms of both noise and activity. The narrow roads and limited access mean that few people use the Character Area to move around the City and as a result, it is generally only used by residents. The Character Area is mainly in residential use but there are also school buildings, offices and buildings with religious associations.From East Bight and James Street there are occasional glimpses through gates and railings, and over the walls on to the properties and gardens beyond. There are enclosed views along the narrow roads on to terminating buildings such as the Cathedral School Boarding House and long views on to the upper parts of the Cathedral.Despite its close proximity and historical relationship to the Cathedral and Bailgate areas of the City, the Character Area is surprisingly detached from surrounding areas. The narrowness of James Street and East Bight, and the height of their boundaries make the buildings within the Character Area separate both from each other and from the city more widely.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 99,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,24,

c8fbec62-734c-408e-9b8e-91dcc6fbce35,LARA RAZ AREA,,Stonepits north-east of the upper city.,"North of Wragby Road and Langworthgate and extending north and west around the north-east corner of the upper city as far as the buildings of the Newport suburb, the land was used for stone-digging. Here the stone was probably not worked from a quarry face (as it was in RAZ 9.41.1 and 9.41.2) but in pits. These pits are frequently mentioned in the documentary sources. The earliest such reference is probably that of 1240 to a quarry on land north of Langworthgate, south of the arable fields, and east of land behind the properties fronting on to Newport (ed. Major 1958, 15-16, No.2200). Like the quarries along the cliffs in the west and South Common fields, there is no indication of the ownership of these stonepits and this might mean that these diggings were also worked by citizens as part of their common rights. Although the techniques of working the stone in these (presumably relatively shallow) pits will have been different from those used on the south and west commons, it may, nevertheless, be possible to use archaeological techniques, and comparison with the organisation of working in RAZ 9. 41.2, to assess whether working in these stonepits was undertaken on a small scale by individual citizens, or by a more commercial operation. A research agenda for quarrying of this type has recently been issued (LUAU 1996a). Some of the stone from such pits might have fed limekilns, but no evidence for limekilns in this area has yet been forthcoming. Indeed, as yet, there is no evidence that the stone was processed in any way in or near the pits. Even so, such processing might be expected and the remains of lime-burning installations should be searched for. It is perhaps less likely that such pits would have produced worthwhile quantities of ironstone and so smelting is perhaps less likely in these areas, whilst it is unlikely that clay was dug in this manner.",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ cannot be described precisely, but the land affected by the excavation of stone from such pits seems to have been bounded by Wragby Road in the south-east and by the rear boundaries of the properties fronting Newport on the west. The 1240 document suggests that Church Lane was the boundary of the stonepit area on the south. The northern extent of the quarrying may be marked, approximately, by the northern boundary of the field known as Stonefield in the 19th century and so the RAZ boundary follows that between the properties behind Newport and Nettleham Road. The remaining boundaries are entirely notional.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.41.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.41.3,

c9bb7fca-21a6-494e-b014-d7600a31268b,LARA RAZ AREA,,"Wigford eastern shoreline - La Gulle, Old Eye and Thorngate","As in the High Medieval Era (RAZ 9.5) this part of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s docksides is also the least well-known and understood at later dates. Documents continue to be scarce indicating, probably, that this area was never particularly intensively developed. It seems to have been during the early part of the Early Modern Era that the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádry land‰Û¡ÌÝå» of Wigford was linked directly with the eyot on which the Thorngate suburb had developed. The area of open water between Wigford and Thorngate, perhaps known as le Gulle in the early 15th century (Hill 1948, 349), became confined within a narrow channel, probably capable of being bridged, and by the 16th century it was no more than a dyke. The sequence by which the area of open water became a formal dyke is not understood. The watching brief at Waterside South (WS82) recorded the western quayside wall of the waterway and the latest pottery from its construction levels was of the 14th century. The analysis of this feature in the published report (Steane et al. 2001, 173-7) suggests that this wall was the west side of the northern extension of Sincil Dyke, but the possibility that it represents the western quayside of a larger open area of water between the Wigford causeway and the Thorngate island should be considered. This open area of water did not last long, however, and, according to the results of the WS82 watching brief the waterway had been filled in by the mid 15th century. Nothing at all is known about the abandonment of the Thorngate quaysides, which are dealt with under RAZ 10.30 below.Filling in the direct connection between the Sincil Dyke and Old Eaa (the watercourse(s) to the south ) and the Witham involved the permanent diversion of these waters to the east, where they run today - and this is where they are shown running in Speed‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Map of 1611. Once the dyke had been filled in, the eastern side of Wigford can have played no further part in the port of Lincoln. The early modern deposits within the RAZ are likely to be of great interest to the archaeology of the city, nonetheless, as the large quantities of rubbish used for the infilling will have been derived from the city itself and, because of the waterlogged condition of the lower deposits, at least, they will survive in exceptional states of preservation.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded to the north by the Witham and to the north-west by High Bridge. The line followed along the eastern side of the Wigford peninsula is largely speculative, although dumping to reclaim land was noted in excavations at the St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Station (east) site. This boundary is likely to extend no further south than Great Gowts, where documents record the Nichorpool at its eastern outfall.

c9bbe4c3-159f-40fb-ae3a-a8d5b2b559cf,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Fossdyke North Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌFossdyke North Character Area is predominantly a residential townscape lying on the west side of Lincoln between the Fossdyke and Carholme Road, the main western entrance to the city. Much of the townscape consists of modern residential development, although a large-scale industrial site is located in the far west of the Character Area.The majority of the area consists of a medium-to-high density of modern residential housing including a private development of terraced houses and bungalows, as well as a number of earlier public apartment blocks and rows of houses. Housing developments correspond to areas of previously undeveloped land or plots formerly occupied by early Victorian terraced housing or industry. Modern housing is arranged within a series of small irregular urban blocks defined by a curvilinear pattern of unconnected cul-de-sacs, which is poorly connected to Carholme Road.The form and style of modern residential housing vary between developments; however, within build units, buildings are coherent in form and scale. Public housing around Carr Street is highly coherent in character and consists of three-storey apartment blocks laid out in a loose geometric pattern within communal grassed areas and car parking, and short rows of two-storey houses. Buildings are constructed of brick and are plain in style.Houses within the most recent development at Roman Wharf consist of short rows of two- to three-storey terraced houses and detached bungalows. Buildings turn their backs on surrounding areas, and face streets or communal car parking areas. Houses are set back 4-5m from the road with small gardens and/or car parking spaces and often have indistinct or low public/private boundaries. Buildings are constructed of small-scale materials including brick and timber cladding. Terraced houses have stepped building lines with countersunk or projecting features. Houses are generally plain in style and frequently incorporate shallow gabled features.An expansive industrial site occupies a very large plot adjacent to the Fossdyke in the west of the area. The main premises consist of a complex amalgamation of buildings dating to the early 20th century onwards. Different stages of its construction can be identified through the varying use of materials and roof types. The site is a secure plot surrounded by tall steel wire fencing with barbed wire top. Within the compound, there are large areas of open space, including a car park and open grassland. Several buildings associated with the industrial complex are located along Carholme Road. The buildings consist of former workers‰Û¡ÌÝå» houses and a vacant office building which form a buffer between the industrial site and the more residential character of Carholme Road. The buildings are constructed of brick and are highly similar in style. Properties are set back 4-5m from the road with grassed areas to the front defined by low brick walls with stone coping and layered brick and tile pillars. Houses are three bays in width and two storeys high with hipped slate roofs with deep-bracketed eaves and tall chimneys. Properties have plain faÌÎå_ades with projecting brick quoins, shallow wings at each side.There is limited open space within the area except for a footpath along the Fossdyke and communal grassed areas around apartment blocks‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 87,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,40,

Although the great majority of the monument lies outside the city boundary, the research agenda for its study is likely to be set in this small section, where investigation prior to development has already taken place. In particular, only work outside the city boundary can establish whether the identified ditch system (which runs approximately north-west to south-east) is joined, or continued, by ditches running across the limestone ridge from east to west. Whatever alterations or adaptations were undertaken in the Roman military period will be of great interest and information suggesting its abandonment will be important. Demolition of the ditch system by the Roman army would indicate their intention to obliterate the Iron Age significance of the hilltop. This would be the implication whether one views the ditches as demarcating a 'sacred' space on the hill top or whether they are viewed as part of a division of the landscape amongst different agricultural owners. On the other hand, retention or adaptation of the earthworks may suggest a less radical approach to the conquered territory. It may indicate, for example, that an ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáenclosed‰Û¡ÌÝå» Iron Age landscape, reserved for the display of tribal status and ritual, gave way to a similarly ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáreserved‰Û¡ÌÝå» enclosure demarcated for use as the legionary prata or territorium.",Summary,"The boundaries of this RAZ are extrapolated from the recording of the triple ditches on aerial photographs.

As we presume it was originally laid out, the market place proved too be much too large, and not only was it halved in size by the construction of Sincil Dyke, but, subsequent to that, in-filling occurred both south of St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and at the Malandry. These episodes of in-filling will provide useful dating information for the sequence of development of the market, although these may still belong to the High Medieval rather than the Early Modern Era. The space south of St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s was occupied by the Tile House (RAZ 10.40) which was certainly in production in the Early Modern Era, and situated to the south or south-east of the Malandry was an important early-modern windmill on its mound which was involved in the disputes between the city and St Katherine‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Priory in the later 15th century (Hill 1948, 347-52) and which was still present in 1519 (Cameron 1985, 184). The precise location of the mill in the RAZ is unknown, but we might expect it to be on the highest ground. Such occupation of areas of the former market for industrial purposes is a matter of some interest especially as, although both the tile house and the mill provided services for the community, and probably remained in the ownership of the City Council, both were evidently leased to private individuals or institutions and disputes over them focused on the extent to which they had to fulfil civic responsibilities. These issues can be assessed archaeologically and future work should focus on establishing the extent of public involvement in these establishments.Plenty of the area in question, south of the Sincil Dyke, has never been built on, however, and it presents us with an excellent opportunity for the archaeological investigation of a long-lived market site. Unfortunately, although rich, the archaeology of such sites is likely to be very fragile and the use of this area for mechanised markets in recent years may have done some damage to deposits.",Summary,"The RAZ for the market includes the broad street itself, with the intention of managing deposits and structures related to the market itself.

ca6424bd-00eb-45da-8ab8-21080431456e,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Free School Lane Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌFree School Lane Character Area is situated close to the centre of the city, between High Street to the west and Broadgate to the east. This location between the retail core of the city and one of the major north-south roads has heavily influenced both its development and continuing role as a place for public buildings such as a library, churches, a theatre and several social clubs.The townscape of the Character Area has developed over an extended period of time, from the Roman Military Era until the Modern Era. Broadgate follows the line of the eastern defensive walls of the lower Roman Colonia [90-410 AD], and Saltergate runs broadly parallel with the southern Roman defences. The pattern of streets also derives from the expansion and reorganisation of the settlement in the High Medieval Era.A number of markets are likely to have been located within or adjacent to the area during the High Medieval and Early Modern eras. The plot and graveyard of the original St. Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Church, built during the High Medieval Era, still survive at the corner of Saltergate and Bank Street, as does the Franciscan Friary at Greyfriars. During the Early Modern Era, a cattle market was located in the area until the second St. Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Church was built on its current site in 1869. Many of the surviving buildings date from the end of the Early Modern Era to the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period, the earliest being those along the east side of Bank Street. Many of the civic buildings were built during the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period. Infill and redevelopment continued with the construction of the Library in 1914 and the Co-op Hall on Free School Lane. Recent development in the Modern Period includes the Lloyds TSB branch on Bank Street and Thorngate House. The Character Area is broadly arranged on a grid pattern contained within the three parallel roads of Bank Street, Free School Lane and Broadgate with a slight incline towards the north as it is situated on the lower slopes of the north escarpment. The second St. Swithin's Church, the Vestry (now a cafÌÎå©) and the public garden form a focal point within the Character Area. The buildings are generally in large individual plots, are often large in scale filling the whole of their plots. Buildings are situated at the back of the footway with active frontages on to the street and as a result, there is quite a high sense of enclosure, particularly in St. Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Square where the buildings have a strong building line. As a result, the Square forms a focal point within the Character Area.Buildings have active frontages facing on to the street and medium solid-to-void ratios. Properties are constructed of small-scale materials including brick and stone, and the latter is often used for decoration. Windows are generally vertical in emphasis and mainly wooden sliding sash windows. The Character Area has a predominantly Late Victorian/Edwardian built form, as this was when the majority of large public buildings such as the library and the social clubs were built. The area also contains a number of buildings from the Inter-War and Modern periods, including the vacant office block on Free School Lane, which has several features that are typical of the 1930s. Thorngate House, built in the modern Period, is taller than other buildings in the Character Area. A feature of several buildings in the Character Area is that they have a dual aspect and face on to St. Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Square and either Broadgate or the river. Within the Character Area, the former St. Swithin's graveyard forms the largest piece of open space and is dominated by large, mature trees. Most of the buildings facing on to it have active frontages. From Broadgate there are also clear views north towards the Cathedral and long-reaching views south on to the south escarpment.The condition of the public realm within the Character Area varies and overall there is an incoherent variety of modern and traditional road/footpath materials and street furniture. The majority of roads are now part of a one-way system that mainly provides access into the Character Area itself. The area is quite busy as people cross it to access car parks on Free School Lane and Broadgate, to catch buses and to walk home, and to visit the several buildings with public uses.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 83,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,57,

It seems that they had used the Guildhall for such events, and in 1731 this arrangement was formalised (Hill 1966, 58). Then, in imitation of the County Assembly Rooms of 1744, City society began to raise funds to build their own assembly room in the lower city. The result was that an assembly hall and other chambers were constructed on top of the new Buttermarket building (RAZ 10.22.8) north of the Civic Church of St Peter-at-Arches. The Buttermarket had apparently already been completed, as a single storey structure, so the new Assembly Room was added on top and this two-phase, dual-purpose, building was demolished in 1938. From the original layout of the buildings it should be possible to understand the way in which the elaborate social dance conducted in an Assembly Room was managed. Each different space will have been carefully fitted and decorated to indicate the relative social status of the occupants and future work should aim at elucidating this elaborate pattern of social spaces. Although they arose from very similar social circumstances, any differences in function between the use of County Assembly Rooms (10.46.3) compared with the City Assembly Rooms will be of great interest as it is probably true to say that the distinction between the two social groups is not well understood.",Summary,The RAZ has the same boundaries as the Butter Market (10.22.8).,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.46.4,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.46.4,

This appeal was made on the grounds that the church was founded and maintained as a private chapel, and by the late medieval period, certainly, the parish was dominated by several major houses (St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáJohn of Gaunt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace‰Û¡ÌÝå» and St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hall - to name only those whose appearance is known to us). The investment of local families like the de Suttons and local institutions like the Guild of St Mary and St Anne (based in the Guildhall) should make the archaeology of St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s particularly interesting in comparison with other churches in Wigford and elsewhere, where we might think such elite investment was absent. We know, for example, of the presence of a notable chapel of St Anne at the church (possibly even a detached structure - Hill 1948, 286). By the end of the medieval period, then, this church has quite a distinctive character and it is important that we explore this distinctive elite character in the High Medieval Era also. Apart from detailing this character, we should also ask whether the church always had this elite character or was it, at its foundation, similar to other Wigford examples? Perhaps, like them, it was simply a church founded by an urban lord to cater for residents in his small urban estate and, if so, it may be possible to explore whether the church was ever within the curia of St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hall to the south (RAZ 9.33). We have no evidence to suggest that there was an earlier elite building on the site of the late 14th-century building called John of Gaunt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace, but it is also possible that the original church foundation was linked with a capital building on this site. It has been suggested that the parish itself may have undergone a major change of character when the building which became St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall was first established in the mid 12th century. At this time, it is argued, members of the aristocratic elite followed the lead, perhaps set by the King himself, in building urban houses in this part of the suburb (Stocker 1991, 34-4, 40) and reflections of this potentially dramatic change in the parish church should be sought and exploited.",Summary,The churchyard plot is known precisely through the analysis of surviving leases and the RAZ includes the whole of the known site.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.19,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.19,

This same analysis also argues that St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s was founded by a larger group of members of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s mercantile elite and the question to be asked at St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is whether the lack of large numbers of monuments here might indicate a more conventional foundation by a single elite family to serve their urban estate. We know that there was a pre-Conquest church on the site, as its west wall has survived (with its long-and-short quoins) below the east wall of the tower (Stocker and Everson forthcoming). It has also been suggested that the church was originally located with its west wall along the street frontage and that the late 11th-century tower was built out on to the street, using the solid Roman road as a foundation. The value of this suggestion should be examined in any works undertaken in the western part of the churchyard or in underpinning the tower as, if true, it would have considerable consequences for the layout of this part of the Wigford suburb. Any works inside the church need to be undertaken in controlled archaeological conditions, so that the sequence of development at St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s can be compared with St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. Its fabric also contains a great deal of information and all repair and restoration works there must be accompanied by programmes of archaeological recording. In the graveyard, also, this question of the relative status of the interred in the 10th and 11th centuries can also be addressed, but only if a valid sample of the burial ground is excavated totally. It is important that the lesson is learnt from the St Mark's excavations and that the whole burial ground is eventually analysed as a single site. The architectural development of St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, like that of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Benedict's, indicates a prosperous parish from the 11th through to the 14th century and although the architectural structure and details of the church are worthy of study in their own right, they should also be seen against the wider economic, social and ritual background of churches in Lincolnshire and England. To the north of the modern church a portion of the graveyard has been adopted by the modern vicarage. We have no information about the location of the medieval clergy house, but it is possible that such a building may have occupied this large space north of the church. Works involving ground disturbance in this area should be monitored to see if information about earlier structures on this site can be recovered and, if it turns out that there were medieval structures here (like those at St John Wigford - 9.60.23- St Mary-le-Wigford and St Botolph 9.60.21), the prospect exists for an early sealed population beneath them - which will be of interest in comparison with these other Wigford graveyards.",Summary,The boundary of the medieval graveyard is known from early mapping and the RAZ includes its whole extent.

cd08fbdc-2759-4e8c-acce-fd5559e384a2,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,South Common Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThis Character Area is made up almost entirely of South Common, which is a large area of common land on the southeastern boundary of the city, bridging the gap between the built-up area and agricultural fields beyond. This Character Area and West Common both play an enormous role in reinforcing the setting of Lincoln as an urban area closely linked to its rural surroundings. This is a huge swathe of natural open space that is close to the city centre but also directly adjacent to the agricultural fields that separate Lincoln from the nearby settlements of Canwick and Bracebridge Heath. The fact that this area is common land gives it an unmanaged and natural character that creates the impression of being right on the edge of the countryside.The Common has an irregular boundary marked by a mixture of Victorian iron railings, a wooden fence, and overgrown hedgerow. Within the site there are small enclosures around two ponds and several areas of plantation. Horses still graze the Common, though much less than in the past. The result is that areas of scrub are starting to encroach on what is predominantly a very large area of open grassland. The Character Area lies on the south side of the Witham Gap, a valley carved by glacial meltwaters through a Jurassic (210-140 million years B.P) limestone ridge. This created an escarpment to the south east of the north escarpment on which the Cathedral and uphill part of the City are situated, which increases in gradient as it gets further away from the city centre. From high up on this escarpment there are panoramic views across the city, extending as far as Boultham Park and the river valley in the west, and the Witham Gap in the east. From the area closer to South Park there are views directly on to the Victorian houses that were built to look out onto the Common. This part of the Common is more urban in character due to the iron railings and remnants of formal sports pitches that are more familiar in formal urban parks. The topography has also been heavily influenced by a succession of uses on the site. From the 12th century pasture may have been improved by the digging of a number of field drains, some of which survive as shallow earthworks running down slope perpendicular to the contours. Quarries and their associated waste are visible in the form of undulating earthworks, former quarry faces, and linear scarps over much of the Common and a number of large earthworks in the upper part of the Common, which are similar in appearance to these former quarry sites, are the locations of former shooting butts which were first established in the Early Industrial Period.The earliest definitive evidence for activity in the Character Area consists of the former route of Ermine Street, a Roman road dating to the Roman Military Era, observable in the form of a low-lying linear earthwork and line of quarries running almost due north from the southern corner of the Common. Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s expansion during the High Medieval Era will have necessitated the extraction of natural resources for use in buildings, industries, and city infrastructure. Quarrying probably ceased in the Early Industrial Period when much of the land surrounding the Character Area was enclosed by Act of Parliament. In so doing, the 1757 Act defined the modern boundaries of South Common. The Post-Railway Expansion [1846-1868 AD] and Late Victorian/Edwardian [1868-1919 AD] Periods saw the Common adopt a more recreational role in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s townscape. In 1844 a rural walk was created along a section of the upper north escarpment, and around the same time the Common was enclosed by iron railings. During the First World War the area was used as a testing ground for ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáLittle Willie‰Û¡ÌÝå», the prototype of the first military tank.The Common now comprises a large area of coarse grassland scattered with planted trees such as lime, beech, ash and sycamore, including several veteran beech and ash trees, and one large elm. The grassland is predominantly of low botanical value but there are some areas of richer, acidic sward and some damper areas. In addition to the scattered trees there are also several strips of plantation along the boundary with the Viking Way and areas of naturally occurring woodland. The other major habitat in this Character Area is fresh water. There are three ponds, two of which are formal ponds surrounded by mown damp, neutral grassland and a variety of trees and shrubs that were fenced off from the rest of the site when the Common was given a more recreational focus.This Character Area is now mainly used for informal recreation. There are no longer any formal sports pitches on the Common but people still use it for walking and for informal play.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 16,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,85,

It seems likely that, as the city grew to its maximum size in the 11th and 12th centuries, the suburb of Butwerk developed on the area which had formerly been occupied by the Beggarsholme fair and we have no documentary evidence for the fair in the 13th and 14th centuries. However, perhaps as a response to the collapse of the economy and the virtual abandonment of the suburb, a new fair was granted in 1409 (Hill 1948, 270). It was to be held between 17th November and 2nd December on St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Closes - east of St Peter ad Fontem (RAZ 10.60.12; map 9/66). The fair may well have represented an attempt to revive both the tradition of the Beggarsholme fair and, perhaps, the trade-routes along the Witham with which it was possibly associated. But it may be the case that trading had continued informally between the merchants unloading their vessels at Stamp End and citizens emerging from the city to meet them. Whereas we are not able to pin down the site of Beggarsholme precisely (although Baggerholme Wong was adjacent to St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Croft), we do know the location of St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Croft (bounded by Montague Street, Croft Street, John Street and Monks Road). Archaeological investigation may, therefore, permit us to investigate the important question of whether the 1409 market was a new institution or whether it was merely a formalisation of an existing gathering. The fair was moved to join the rest of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s markets in the High Street around and south of Stonebow in 1707 (HMC 1895, 114). Furthermore by 1722 the city proceeded to let the two formerly communal closes in which the fair had been held (St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Croft and Beggarsholme Close) to private individuals (ed. Birch 1906, 31, Nos. 174 & 177).",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ follow those of St Hugh's Closes, which are known from documentary sources.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.18,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.18,

cd2a27be-7fb3-405c-b8c4-06a10694d5f6,LARA RAZ AREA,,Houses in the Bail (and the Close within St Mary Magdalene‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish),"We are very fortunate in Lincoln to have such relatively complete survival of early domestic building in the upper city, the survivals of associated documents, and to have this resource so comprehensively and usefully studied (Jones et al. 1984 -1996). Within this RAZ the buildings are mostly of two types; large, almost palatial, domestic complexes around the cathedral itself and more modest, commercial, buildings along Bailgate. All evidence gathered from the buildings' fabric will add to our picture of the development of both commercial and domestic architecture in the city, but as this collection of buildings is outstanding at a national level, every detail must be recorded to achieve better understanding of the development of urban architecture in general. When the tenements on Bailgate were first constructed in the mid-12th century, they were of the highest quality, mostly built of stone and some with fine architectural detailing, but towards the end of the Middle Ages and on into the 17th century, buildings were of timber and became less substantial in quality, and it is these buildings which predominate today. The Bailgate buildings might be able throw light on the problems recently posed by Harris (1994) and Clark (2000) about the extent to which parts of the buildings, other than the ground floor chambers on the street front, played a role in the commercial use of such ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáshops‰Û¡ÌÝå». The buildings of Bailgate retain a number of cellars of the type which Harris shows were used either as retail spaces or as taverns, and they also retain a number of chambers over the ground floor shops, which have previously been interpreted as domestic quarters but which Harris wishes to see as further retail space. The question is, what were the connections between such street front properties and the buildings which lay behind them? The different degrees of connection between the two types of unit have formed the basis of a useful, recently-proposed, typology of late medieval shops (Clark 2000). Many of the houses also retain fragments of halls laid gable-on to the street and reached through the street frontage, which must surely have played a primarily domestic role (Stocker 2002). Merchants in the upper city, of course, benefited from the stable and wealthy markets provided by the resident civil, military and ecclesiastical elites, and may therefore have been somewhat atypical of the wider city. For example, they may not have been quite so severely affected as their colleagues below hill by the economic collapse of the late 13th century, but even so, variations in the pattern of repair and abandonment, when viewed across groups of tenements, should reflect fluctuations in the upper city economy, which can be compared and contrasted with the economy of the lower city - presumed to be quite different. East of Bailgate the domestic architecture seems more diverse, and the cathedral has prepared its own research agenda (Gibbs 2001). In Eastgate, James Street and around the Minster Yard, houses are typically grand establishments set within their own, sometimes walled, enclosures. Frequently these are planned around a courtyard, the most expansive of medieval town-house plans. Such establishments also bear comparison with rural manor houses (such as Willingthorpe) and investigations of their archaeology and architectural history should follow the agendas established for buildings in this class (e.g. Pantin 1962-3; Schofield 1994; 1997). It must be stressed that Lincoln has one of the very finest collections of such capital urban buildings in the country and appropriate recording and analysis is not just important for Lincoln, but also for the understanding of medieval architecture more generally. So not only does Bailgate have a very fine group representing the commercial/domestic buildings of the mercantile elite, but the Close has an exceptional group of buildings belonging to the ecclesiastical elite, with which they can be compar",Summary,The RAZ is defined by the walls of the upper city and takes the line of the parish boundary between St Margaret and St Mary Magdalene through the cathedral (which reflects the line of the city wall prior to the late 12th century).,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.24,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.24,

Like five out of the six churches in Butwerk, St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish had fewer than 10 inhabitants in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287) but it seems to have responded to this situation differently. When the collapse in population in the Butwerk rendered most of the churches redundant, instead of dwindling away as St Bavon and St Rumbold did, St Peter was taken up by the Monks of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey York and appropriated to their cell at Black Monks in 1461 (ed Page 1906, 130) ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáon account of the church falling to the ground and there being no parishioners to rebuild it‰Û¡ÌÝå». The Monks apparently ensured that services were maintained there and we have to ask why St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s should be treated in this way. One possibility is that the monks regarded custodianship of the spring, after which the church and parish were named, as an important matter, parishioners or no parishioners and were therefore content to add the management of a round of services here to their responsibilities. Whatever the reason, however, these usual late-medieval arrangements are likely to be reflected in the Early Modern archaeological record, and unusual and interesting structures may be found at both church and spring site (which was presumably located north of Monks Road - at least originally). The church is not one of those which the City Council tried to liquidate for their own benefit in the Reformation period and the site passed into to the hands of the post-Dissolution owners of Monks' Abbey in 1540 (RAZ 10.55 - Dugdale I, 619). This grant makes no reference to any church building, only to the cemetery, which was in the hands of a chaplain, and we might therefore presume that the church had gone by this date.",Summary,"Unfortunately the site of the churchyard is only approximately located from discoveries made during building work in 1857. It was clearly bounded on the north by Monks Road and it lay east of Rosemary Lane, but the original account does not report precisely where (Ross Annales 3 p.112). Writing thirty years later Venables (1887-8, 335-6) declared that the discoveries had been made between the overflow burial ground for St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and Monks Road and it is here that we have located the RAZ. Venables states that the southern boundary of St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churchyard was adjoined by the northern boundary of the new St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s cemetery, which implies a very large churchyard. We have no evidence at all for its east boundary.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.12,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.12,

Even if the dedication is to St Augustine of Canterbury (rather than St Augustine of Hippo) there is no real reason to think this church is any earlier in foundation date than the majority of churches within the city (i.e. from the mid 10th century onwards). If the church is dedicated to St Augustine of Canterbury, it might be argued that this is yet another church with a West Saxon dedication (like Sts Edward, Swithin and possibly Rumbold), and this in its turn would suggest a foundation date following the reconquest of the city by the Kings of Wessex in 942. Its date of foundation relative to St Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (RAZ 9.60.9) and St Bavon (RAZ 9.60.10) will be of interest as such information might give us a clue as to whether it was founded as part of a single episode of large-scale urban planning, or whether Butwerk developed piecemeal in small plots. As the majority of the wharves along Waterside North were evidently within the parish, we might anticipate that this church was relatively wealthy compared with some of its Butwerk neighbours and, indeed, it is the only one of the Butwerk parishes which still retained more than 10 parishioners in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287-8). These indications of relative wealth and association with the heart of the maritime city may have made the church distinctive in its plan form and superstructure compared with its neighbours in Butwerk, and can be explored archaeologically. Similarly, its graveyard population may reflect its distinctiveness, perhaps including seamen and possibly immigrants. It is not clear, however, that many merchants themselves lived in this parish, although some who lived elsewhere in the city left bequests here (eg. ed. Foster 1914, 164).",Summary,"The RAZ includes the whole churchyard, all four boundaries of which have been traced by Mr Johnson (1992).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.11,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.11,

Evidence for such rituals associated with the springs may be provided by the discovery of an early Roman amphora in a purpose-made pit near the known springs along Spring Hill, close to the site of the medieval church of St Peter Stanthaket.In Chapter 5a it is suggested that there must have been an Iron Age route way running diagonally up the hill slope from the end of the Stamp End causeway towards the hill-top; this track presumably awaits discovery somewhere within the eastern part of RAZ 6.13. As the route way between the hypothetical hill top enclosure (RAZs 5.3 & 6.8) and the northern terminal of the causeway at Stamp End (RAZ 5.2 and RAZ 6.4), it might itself have played a ceremonial role. As Mr Jones explains, however, it is not clear that there was any occupation at all on the remainder of the difficult hillside, to the east and west of the spinal road which linked the northern bridgehead of the Wigford causeway with the fortress. Undoubtedly such occupation developed within the colonia, but we still need to establish any such presence in the Military Era. Although pottery of 1st-century date has been found on the hill side, there is a suspicion that it is re-deposited, and evidence for such re-deposition should be searched out, both in artefacts from new sites and in collections of archived material which have a reliable provenance.",Summary,"This RAZ is in two parts either side of RAZ 6.12. To the west it is defined by the cliff edge on the north and the cliff foot to the south. The western boundary has been drawn well to the west of the later colonia wall, but it is notional, as it is not clear how far along the cliff we should expect to find settlement archaeology related to the Roman camp and fortress. The northern and southern boundaries of the eastern part of RAZ 6.13 are along the cliff top and the cliff foot also.

This process needs to be better documented for the Early Modern Era, however, and in particular a dating framework needs to be firmly established. Furthermore, investigation so far has been confined either to the sequence of quaysides or to properties on the High Street frontage. We are without any understanding of the buildings which must have existed facing the water across the quayside itself. Such buildings will be of great importance in characterising the trade undertaken from the Wigford shoreline and the dates at which it was active. Presumably this area of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s waterfront was most active when the Fossdyke was in full operation, i.e. in the period between the 10th and the 14th centuries, and as it seems to have been again in the Industrial Era. Given this association, future work here should ask whether development on the Wigford western shoreline was entirely dependent on the Fossdyke.",Summary,"The limits of the reclaimed land in the north-western part of Wigford are relatively clearly understood and so the RAZ follows the modern edge of the Witham along the west and north and a line through the properties parallel with the street and about 150m to the west. The southern boundary of the RAZ is the great Gowts, which Mr Vince shows was the limit of the early medieval suburb, and south of which the waterside is likely to have had a different sequence of development.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.4,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.4,

cde7fefa-b987-43bf-ad2e-68a254a6bec5,LARA RAZ AREA,,"Wigford eastern shoreline - La Gulle, Old Eye and Thorngate","The final area of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s medieval docksides is the least well-known and understood. Documents are scarce and this may be a sign that this area was never particularly intensively developed. It is abundantly clear that in the 10th century the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádry land‰Û¡ÌÝå» of Wigford did not link directly with the proposed eyot on which the Thorngate suburb was to develop. Similarly it is clear that there was an area to the south of the Thorngate eyot and to the east of the Wigford peninsula which was seasonally or permanently flooded. This area of water is referred to by different names at different periods, it is frequently called the Old Eaa, which is sometimes called a lake (stagnum) and sometimes an expanse of water (aquam) (Cameron 1985, 37-8 ). The Gulle, (occurs in 1409 - Hill 1948, 349) probably refers to a slightly different part of this area of water, perhaps between the Thorngate eyot and the Witham main channel. At the south end of this area of water lay the Nichorpool, which was fed directly from the Witham by the Great Gowt. By the 16th century this whole area of water and water-logged ground had been converted by the construction of the Sincil Dyke (the name first occurs in 1529 - Cameron 1985, 38) into usable hard land. The stages by which the area of open water became dry land, however, are simply not understood and intensive work is required before we can chart the development of this key component of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s topography, and such understanding should be the main aim of further research within this RAZ. At the northern end of the Wigford peninsula we know that there was a waterfront at the eastern ends of the properties stretching back eastwards from High Street in the parishes of St John and St Mary-le-Wigford. Eventually the stretch of open water between the eastern end of the properties in Wigford and the western properties on the Thorngate island (perhaps the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáinlet‰Û¡ÌÝå» known as La Gulle in 1409 - Hill 1948, 349) was reduced from a broad channel to a ditch, which was seen in salvage excavations in 1981 (Gilmour and Stocker 1986, 1-2). This channel was itself filled in between 1475 and 1611 and is now marked by the modern Sincil Street. We need to understand the sequence of reclamation by which this major transformation occurred and its date. We do not know how far south commercial exploitation of the eastern Wigford waterfront extended. In both cases we might expect the sequence of development here to have been similar to that on the west side of the peninsula, starting with a hard, perhaps, which was replaced by successive waterfronts extending further and further eastwards into the water. A similar process was probably underway along the northern side of the eyot of Thorngate, and there was a quayside here by the 13th century. We have no record that the south side of Thorngate island or the northern waterfront of the area of meadows to the south were ever exploited commercially.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded to the north by the centre line of the modern channel of the Witham and to the north-west by High Bridge. The line followed along the eastern side of the Wigford peninsula is largely speculative, although dumping to reclaim land was excavated at the St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Station (east) site (ZE87). This boundary is likely to extend no further south than Great Gowts, where documents record the Nichorpool at its eastern outfall.

Baker (Baker 1936), on the site of the Technical College. By rights this ought to be an early kiln, and represent the same search for a marginal site near the sources of water and clay which characterise the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáRacecourse‰Û¡ÌÝå» and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáSwanpool‰Û¡ÌÝå» pottery industries (RAZ 7.3, RAZ 7.4.1). In this case, however, the site was only marginal in the early years of the colonia. The area as a whole was subsequently appropriated, both for a cemetery, and for suburban housing. It is thought that the re-location of pottery production sites from urban to rural locations in a 3rd- or 4th-century development (Millett 1990, 165) and so we should explore the possibility that the kiln is the predecessor of the more rural ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáRacecourse‰Û¡ÌÝå» and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáSwanpool‰Û¡ÌÝå» industries. If such a transfer from the city to the countryside can be demonstrated, of course, the pottery industry can be seen as an indicator of the same ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivatisation‰Û¡ÌÝå» of civic space in the late Roman period, seen in many of the RAZs of the Roman Colonia Era. Unfortunately, dating of the features in this part of the town has not been sufficiently refined to establish whether this straightforward chronology is born out by the finds, or whether a more complex sequences of land uses occurred. Further work on the kiln products is urgently needed as the period of the kiln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s operation should be both relatively short and independently datable through finds of other types made in the subsequent cemetery (RAZ 7.24) and housing area (RAZ 7.11.3).",Summary,"The boundaries for this RAZ are poorly defined. The western boundary is taken to be the eastern wall of the lower city, although it is quite possible that pottery manufacture and other industries (perhaps particularly quarrying industries) existed further to the west before the lower city wall was built. Otherwise the northern boundary is likely to be the top of the cliff (on the approximate line of modern Lindum Terrace) as clay was not obtained at higher levels than this in the cliff face. The eastern boundary is presumed to abut the western boundary of RAZ 7.23 (the Greetwell Villa estate), whilst an arbitrary southern boundary has been selected along the line of the modern Monks Road",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.4.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.4.2,

The association of the area outside the upper Westgate with justice, however, was perpetuated into the Industrial Era by the continuing use of the gallows, north of Westgate, presumably right up to 1814, when hangings were transferred to the castle itself. The archaeology of the gallows site, though grisly, will be of some technical interest. We should be interested both in the date of the earliest gallows on this site and in the type of structure erected here at various phases of use. We should also be alert to the possibility that there might be human burials in the vicinity. Although the burial of the condemned in specified graveyards was a part of medieval charity, it is not known what arrangements were made from the Reformation to the 19th century.",Summary,The RAZ includes the plot marked on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map as the site of the old gallows.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.69,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.69,

Consequently, the modern city includes small parts of the open field systems of the parishes of Nettleham and Greetwell. The boundary between the field system of Lincoln and field system belonging to Nettleham was marked by a feature in the landscape, probably a ditch and bank perhaps enhanced by a hedge, which was known as Nettleham Mere until at least the 15th century (Cameron 1985, 185). There is no documentary evidence for similar feature dividing the city from the open fields of Burton, but it is highly likely that there was such a feature and by 1560 this boundary was known as Burton Hedge (Cameron 1985, 179). There is also no such evidence for the boundary with the fields of Greetwell, but such a boundary is very likely to have existed. Where the roads to Burton and Wragby cross this feature we might expect a marker of some type (like those documented on Greetwell Road, Nettleham Road, and Ermine Street) and these should be searched for in future research. In the Early Modern Era the focus of interest in this feature should be on the frequency and quality of its maintenance. Presumably the boundary would have been better maintained at times of greater competition between the various field systems. The state of the boundary might also reflect the agricultural regime in operation. Stock would require a more solid boundary than arable, for example.",Summary,"To the north-east and east the RAZ is conceived as a band 100m wide following the known line of the former city boundary; however, to the north and north-west, the boundary has remained stable - so half of the presumed archaeological feature is within the modern parishes of Riseholme and Burton.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.45.6,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.45.6,

d2036f87-03c4-48e2-ae97-9a6f8d8b7e17,LARA RAZ AREA,,Heavy engineering works,"Between the 1840s and the 1940s Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s major industry was heavy engineering. Plants of great size were eventually laid out in the valley bottom east and west of Wigford and, as a group, they constitute one of the most important surviving resources of industrial archaeology in the city and in the Midlands more widely. To the south-east of the historic core, the works originally occupied much of Waterside North, east of Broadgate, a large site to the east of Stamp End and south of the railway embankment, the whole of the area between Melville Street/Canwick Road and the wash lands to the east of the city. To the west of Wigford the engineering works occupied almost all the land between Coulson Street and the marshalling yards to the north on the west side of the Witham, with the Sheaf Wood Works extending eastwards across the Witham, on to the Wigford peninsula itself. These engineering works all developed their individual specialisms, but the industrial components are broadly similar and so all these sites are bounded within a single research agenda. Essentially all were using imported iron, steel and wood, which arrived by railway, to construct a bewildering variety of engines and machines. We should ask how the necessary skills were developed from the limited craft-based skills which must have existed previously (RAZs 11.5.1 & 11.35). At first, the machines were mainly for agricultural use, and initially almost all firms produced traction engines, but subsequently several firms diversified into specific components, or into specialist machines - Ruston‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, for example developed into the premier national firm constructing excavation machinery, whilst Clayton‰Û¡ÌÝå»s became known for railway rolling-stock. For the most part this sort of work was undertaken in two distinct phases, manufacture of components and assembly. Some firms only undertook one part of the work - Clarke‰Û¡ÌÝå»s for example manufactured only castings, but most both manufactured the components and then assembled them into machines. The furnaces and forges used in the manufacturing processes are of great interest and many remains will survive both buried below ground and comprehensible in the superstructure of buildings. There is a great literature on these machines (eg, Colsell 1986; Brooks 1986; Clarke 1955) and a detailed research agenda is urgently required for Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s own products. The second stage, assembly, went on in large barn-like sheds which housed teams of workers whose specialist skills were brought to each individual assembly site as they were needed. This makes the planning of space within the factories a matter of great interest, contrasting as it does with manufacturing ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáline‰Û¡ÌÝå» systems, which eventually became the norm. In this type of production facility each specialism tended to have its own ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáshop‰Û¡ÌÝå» with specialist types of furnaces, benches and tools and this placed great emphasis on the skills of the individual workman/woman. Although the details of each sub-trade can be reconstructed from documentary sources, many of the skills themselves were left undocumented or unremarked upon and can now only be fully appreciated by investigating the workplaces of the tradesmen. A concordance of the skills and a research agenda for assembly works of this type is provided by the Step 1 Report on the engineering industry (Crossley 1994; forthcoming).There are a few extant examples of small- or medium-scale engineering industry sites, which were mostly situated in the area of Broadgate, St Rumbold Street and Monks Road. Rainforth‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Implement Works is now the Temple Building, of Lincoln College, Monks Road (Herridge 1999, 5021). The standing building is dated 1887. Rainforth‰Û¡ÌÝå»s went into voluntary liquidation in 1933, the business being taken over by A G Parrot, followed by S W Thorne and J Carrot who made bus and coach bodies for Lincolnshire Road Car until 1935. By 1937 it was a motor garage run by A R Hill Ltd and later by Mansbridge.

The modern bridge (RAZ 11.6.2) replaced a ramshackle causeway and bridge of seven arches. The arches were evidently of different dates, having been repaired by different authorities at different times (Hill 1948, 357-8). As it was a vital artery, the City Council sometimes shouldered responsibility for repairs, but frequently they expected other parties to share the costs with them. The structural history of the bridge was clearly complex and important evidence for the medieval bridge and its associated causeways is likely to survive to east and west of the modern bridge abutments. As the city was so directly involved in its maintenance, its structure will provide some sort of indicator for the vitality of communications (and thus trade) with the south-west throughout the Early Modern Era. This aspect of the structure should be explored in future work here. From 1466, when Bracebridge was added to the County of the city, this bridge was the county boundary - it is possible that this new function was marked by a boundary marker of some sort on the western side of the bridge.",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include not just the area of the modern bridge, but also lengths of the causeway on either side, which is mentioned by name in 1563 (Cameron 1985, 179), but which must have existed much earlier.

Like St Giles, however, there can have been few inhabitants in the parish who were not also inmates of the hospital and the 1428 subsidy collectors reported fewer than 10 (Hill 1948, 287). We have no information about the redundancy of the church except that its parish was united with St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s in the Act of Parliament of 1549. The fact that the city made no move to dispose of it themselves probably meant that the church had been considered parcel of the Malandry site itself and that it had passed, like St Peter ad Fontem, to the secular owners of the hospital site (RAZ 10.56). We know nothing of the post-Dissolution history of the church and any information about its deconsecration and demolition will be of interest.",Summary,"It is clear that Holy Innocents was located within the Malandry precinct, (RAZ 9.56), but, although burials were discovered when the railway line was put through the southern part of the precinct (Brooks 1934-5, 178) it is not known whether they represented the parochial burial ground.

This appears to have been an early name for the street which ran along the outside of the south wall of the lower city, along the line now taken by Guildhall Street. Tenements along this street, certainly to the south, though possibly to the north also (once the city wall had been breached), are likely to incorporate baking equipment such as the bases of ovens etc. As one of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s few clearly documented artisanal areas, the context in which the bread was being baked is also of interest. Were the bakeries within tenements occupied domestically, and, if so, was a shop provided on the street front? As the producers of one of the staples for the city, its population and economy ought to be reflected in the numbers of bakers in Baxtergate, although it may take some time for meaningful statistics on such issues to be collected. It is possible that Baxtergate originally extended east of Stonebow, as there is a reference to an oven in Saltergate in the 13th century (Hill 1948, 157). If it did prove to extend this far east, it would further emphasise how relatively unimportant the stretch of quayside east of the Stonebow was for waterborne traffic in the High Middle Ages. The evidence for medieval bakeries has not really been effectively synthesised and, as we can identify the bakers' street in Lincoln, it offers an important case study for the archaeology of this industry in its context.",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries are intended to include the tenements along either side of the presumed Baxtergate, extending back to the presumed line of St Mary Stighe on the south side and the line of the presumed Lewinstighe (Mint Street) on the north.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.38,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.38,

d3b541e7-7b10-4e35-abd6-03a516043351,LARA RAZ AREA,,Animal processing industries,"With its rural hinterland it is not surprising that, in the Industrial Era, Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s animal processing works became industrialised and began to serve a national as well as a local market. Once again this development would not have been possible without the railways, and it is only subsequent to their arrival in the 1840s that the small-scale abattoirs, tanneries and glue manufacturers began to operate on an industrial and mechanised scale. A city abattoir had been established in the northern part of the new Beast Market (RAZ 11.23) by the end of the 19th century (perhaps to replace the shambles in Butchery Street/ Clasketgate - RAZ 11.24), and the Co-operative Slaughterhouse is marked on the 1887 O.S. map south of Sincil, Dyke and east of Pelham Street (Herridge 1999, No.5166). These will be interesting structures archaeologically as little seems to be known about the early history of the mechanisation of animal slaughter. Work here should aim to discover how completely mechanisation of the process was introduced and at what date. In the mid 1930s the new Curtis‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abattoir, was built in St Mark's Street (Herridge 1999, No.5476). The layout and techniques used in this new abattoir will make an interesting comparison with results from the former city abattoir on Monks Road and a similar research agenda should apply. An equally interesting topic for research will be the way in which this large mechanised abattoir developed from early private facilities on the site. Curtis's retail butchers and cooked meat retail shop have been at 164 High Street (i.e. east of the abattoir) since 1828.The bones of slaughtered animals served a number of roles, but almost all required them to be ground to a powder first, and a bone mill is marked on the 1st edition O.S. map located behind Waterside South (below the 1938 market extension) (Herridge 1999, No.5109). This is a key site for understanding the animal processing industry in the city as excavation may tell which of the many potential uses for bone meal was intended. Although bone meal would have been needed for the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s substantial glue industry (see below) it is also possible that some of the bone ground here went into fertilisers and chemicals being produced to the west along the Fossdyke (RAZ 11.43). This mill, however, seems to have had rather restricted access and the methods of transport which linked it to these other industries (and indeed to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s slaughterhouses) need to be much better understood. The hides of animals slaughtered in Lincoln and in the countryside around had long been the basis of a tanning industry (RAZ 9.34; 10.33 & 10.34). The most impressive visible remains of this industry are at the Tannery, Tanners Lane (Herridge 1999, No.5114). This site, situated on the east bank of the upper Witham south of Firth Road, was in operation from the early 19th century, and probably earlier, and dating the origin of the industry provides the first research objective on the site. Given the known population of tanners in Wigford in the Medieval and Early Modern Eras, it is possible that this site developed from earlier tanneries here. Consequently we may be able to observe the impact of mass transport of fuel and goods on this vital industry. There will have been changes in scale and in technology once the canals (and subsequently the railways) arrived, which will make this site very valuable in archaeological terms. The surviving building, of c1900, is of some importance in its own right as an (increasingly rare) example of a mechanised tannery and must be recorded in detail prior to alteration.Animal hides became the basis of specialised industries, which united the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s animal products with its engineering industries. In the case of James Dawson and Son Ltd, in Beevor Street (Herridge 1999, No.5107) a factory was set up to manufacture leather belting for drive-power. This specialised component of the engineering industry was essential both to",Summary,The various RAZ elements are mapped following the sites‰Û¡ÌÝå» depictions on the 1887 O.S. map and include a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.37,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.37,

d3c496c2-2994-4fa3-82ee-4c7c7b6f2e03,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Faith-in-Newland,"St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s is an unusual church in the Lincoln group of suburban churches (RAZ 9.60.15). It may have disappeared very early; by 1263 the parish had been united with St Mary-le-Wigford (Hill 1948, 138) and after this, presumably, if it survived at all, the church would have been relegated to a chapel of ease. Whether it was demolished or converted is an important local issue on which archaeology can shed light, and the details of the conversion will be of great interest. Similarly we have no idea how long the former manor of Willingthorpe survived as a distinct entity in this part of the city, and the survival of the church (in whatever form) might give us a clue to the survival of the manor itself. Some hint of the fate of St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s after the Reformation is provided by the reference in Thomas Sympson‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Adversaria (1737, 287) to the active brick works here in the early 18th century, which had occasionally encountered buried coffins that were used as horse-troughs. This is probably the same brick kiln reported in 1687 to have been brought into being during the life-time of the then occupant - John Scrimshaw (Cameron 1985, 177). In RAZ 10.41.1 it is argued that there were ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon‰Û¡ÌÝå» clay diggings on the common fields west of Newland in the Early Modern Era and that such diggings would have required a common kiln in which to fire their clay. It is possible that this is the origin of the brick works on St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churchyard. The City Council would have taken control of the churchyard after the Act of Union of Parishes in 1549 and it would have been in an ideal location for the construction of a common brick kiln. This possibility can be explored archaeologically in future work on this RAZ and the results should be compared with the comparable kiln at St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s - where a more detailed research agenda for such kiln sites is set out (RAZ 9.40.2, 10.40).",Summary,"The general location of the church is known, but the enclosure which has been identified between Newland Street West, Charles Street West, South Parade and West Parade is likely to represent the whole curia of the manor and not just the churchyard.

Following several local scandals and the passage of the Public Health Act of 1848, Lincoln adopted a typical solution; areas of open land, on the outskirts of the city were designated as cemeteries (Mills 2001). The ""Downhill"" parishes (except St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s which had just acquired its own overspill cemetery - RAZ 11.92.8) grouped together to purchase land along the Washingborough Road (Hill 1974, 159-60). The new cemetery was to cater for both Anglicans and Dissenters and this led to protracted disputes during the design and construction of the new Washingborough Road cemetery in 1856. The cemetery was extended by 10 acres to the east in 1898. The burials were segregated, and, although the two chapel buildings (designed by Michael Drury) look superficially similar, their designs incorporate many differences which represent differences in doctrine. Both buildings should be the subject of recording programmes aimed at elucidating these differences during the course of repair or alterations. The Lodges are also interesting buildings and recording work should focus on documenting the standard of living originally provided for employees of the cemetery. Comparisons with both tied workers' housing in the city (for example with the toll keeper just across Washingborough Road - 11.7.2) and untied housing would be valuable. Similarly, the planting and design of the different areas of the cemetery, as well as the type of monuments used, also offer material for a valuable comparative study. As the burials were segregated between Anglicans and Dissenters, the cemetery offers an excellent opportunity to make an extensive comparative paleopathological study of the two populations. In 1899 St Swithin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s bought a plot of land next to the cemetery for a new ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoverspill‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Hill 1974, 160n) to replace their first ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáoverspill‰Û¡ÌÝå» cemetery in Rosemary Lane (RAZ 11.92.8) and a chapel was provided here also, which should be the subject of recording during repair and restoration, using a similar agenda as proposed for the earlier chapels. ""Uphill"", St Peter Eastgate provided itself with a new cemetery behind its vicarage off Nettleham Road, and St Nicholas was able to acquire a plot to the east of the new church (RAZ 11.92.7). It is not reported whether these cemeteries also contained dissenters, though they may have done and so similar research could be done here as at the Washingborough Road site.",Summary,The RAZs include the entire cemetery plots as mapped on the 2nd edition O.S. map.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.99,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.99,

This has resulted in a largely uniform townscape. There is a street pattern of very curved, mainly residential streets that often loop back on themselves and with noticeably fewer cul-de-sacs than neighbouring Ermine West Character Area. Most of the housing was built in a Modernist-influenced style with little or no external decorative detailing, mainly in red or yellow brick. The housing is mainly two storey and semi-detached with some rows of two-storey houses, bungalows and three-storey apartment blocks. There is a pocket of distinctive bungalows in the south of the area around Aubourn Avenue that have a distinctive roofline.The central green space in the character area, although not publicly accessible, is overlooked by houses. There are three groups of civic buildings, all set on their own plots back from the footway. It is very difficult to move across the area and there is only one road access in eastern, western and southern directions and no axial routes across the area. A common characteristic throughout the area are the footpaths that run along the front of buildings on the other side of a wide grass verge away from the road. There is a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌávillage green‰Û¡ÌÝå» style layout of houses in many places, e.g. Broxholme Gardens with the houses laid out around a central grassed space.There are small-to-medium urban blocks, and many of these are curved, creating a lack of legibility with some irregularly-shaped large blocks along the northern boundary and in the centre of the locality.

d681d978-baf7-4771-b688-75a208a4aa34,LARA RAZ AREA,,Upper city defences,"Throughout the High Medieval Era the upper city defences were essentially those of the Roman upper city. We have no evidence at all that the walls were altered, although it is surely likely that wall-walks and battlements will have been repaired and other maintenance carried out. The question is, at what dates did such re-edification take place? For the pre-Norman period there are essentially two views. The first would see the walls surrounding the upper city as a matter of little importance, or even an obstacle in the development of the Anglo-Scandinavian town. The walls might have been useful for legal purposes, defining the edge of settlement, perhaps the edge of a market trading area, but they were not valued primarily for their military role. This view envisages the upper city walls as essentially similar to those that surrounded the lower city. The second view would see the upper Roman enclosure as being distinct from the lower, and would propose that this distinction was maintained and enhanced. In this view the fortifications carried a prestigious symbolic value and were appropriated by the various elites of pre-Norman Lincolnshire as their military base and symbolic ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácapital‰Û¡ÌÝå». According to this second view, we might propose that it was the upper Roman enclosure that attracted the Vikings in the second half of the 9th century. The Viking armies may have appreciated the defensive and symbolic value of occupying and fortifying the Roman site. We have some evidence that the Viking armies sought out such existing enclosures during the period before they settled the land. Not all of the sites the Viking armies occupied were of this type, but a case can be made that an earlier enclosure around St Peter‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church at Stamford was used in this way by the Viking armies, prior to the establishment of the burgh to the east. Similarly it is possible that it was the pre-existing iron-age earthwork at Thetford which attracted the army to occupy this site. Leicester and Cambridge, like Lincoln, provided former Roman enclosures, whilst Northampton may have been laid out around a pre-Viking aristocratic site. Even if we accept this second view, it is still possible that the Viking army, looking around northern Lincolnshire in this way for suitable enclosures in which to establish military bases, would have selected the whole Roman enclosure, and not just the upper city. Critical evidence relating to this point might be accessible along the south wall of the upper city. Either this wall was re-edified and maintained in the 10th and 11th centuries, in which case we may divide the interpretation of the upper city from the lower, or it was not, and a case for a single interpretation of the two enclosures will look more credible. The only excavated evidence we have for the character of the defensive enclosure of the upper city in the pre-Norman period is the sunken building at St Paul-in-the-Bail (RAZ 9.24) and, as explained in that account, that building can be interpreted as supporting either the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáreserved enclosure‰Û¡ÌÝå» view of the upper city, or the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáAnglo-Scandinavian market‰Û¡ÌÝå» view. Further excavations in the upper city, however, should focus on elucidation of this point. What was the essential character of the upper enclosure in the Anglo-Scandinavian period?It is now clear, however, that in 1068 when Lincoln Castle was founded, the new castle consisted of the whole upper city enclosure and not just the present castle enclosure (Stocker and Vince, 1997; Stocker forthcoming a). This important conclusion arising out of Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work must fundamentally alter our view of the Norman city. Whether one can read backwards from the decision to include the whole of the upper city within the Castle and deduce that, therefore, the whole of the upper city was a reserved aristocratic enclosure in the pre-Conquest period is a moot point. Although excavations on the interior of the upper city should be our most important source of new inf",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the known remains of the walls themselves, along with a zone 10m wide along the inside to include such things as internal staircases and towers, and the ditch on the outside.

The roads on which the buses and private cars ran were not specially adapted to carry them and so there is little left in the archaeological record to mark their presence. However there are several structures of the Industrial Era which mark the arrival and progress of the bus network and private motor vehicle.The city bus garage was built for the Lincolnshire Road Car Co. by Wm. Wright and Son in 1929 on the site of Harrison's Malleable Iron Works in St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street (Herridge 1999, No.5104). The building incorporated the red-brick administration building which appeared to date from the construction of the original building. The original layout of the garage should be preserved below the surviving floor and will give information about the management of the buses in the early terminus. The extent to which civic investment was declared in the bus garage can be instructively compared with the effort made to support innovative technology when the council took over the electric tramway (RAZ 11.9). It is unlikely that pride in civic investment will have declined during the intervening period, but it may be that the mode of its expression had changed. It was demolished in 2002 without detailed archaeological recording.",Summary,The RAZ includes the whole of the original site of the bus garage.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.10.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.10.1,

d778294d-4fc5-4c96-8084-a3f24565f51d,LARA RAZ AREA,,Early graveyard around St Mary of Lincoln,"In 1264 the Dean and Chapter acquired land in the newly-enclosed area south-east of the Angel Choir to be used as the Cathedral cemetery (RAZ 9.62). Prior to the extension of the Close and the radical re-organisation which that involved, however, the Cathedral had an extensive burial ground probably extending from the area later occupied by the Cloister, Deanery and Works Chantry on the north side of the church, right round the west end and on to the south side. Archaeological evidence for the existence of this burial ground in the pre-Conquest period is provided by the discovery in 1882 of an apparently intact grave-cover of early 11th-century date to the west of the West Front (Everson and Stocker 1999, 194-5). Furthermore, although undated, the discovery of Christian burials to the west of the eastern Exchequergate in 1831 (Jones et al., 1987, 91) and again in 1981 (ON9) demonstrates that, before the Close Wall was built in the late 13th century, this burial ground extended westwards at least as far as Castle Square. Documentary evidence for this graveyard is not plentiful, although it is probably synonymous with the 'atrium' of the Cathedral, which occurs in some 13th-century documents (Jones et al. 1990, 5, 19-20). One of these (ed. Major 1973, 260-1, RA 2925) suggests that in the 1220s, before the Deanery was reconstructed as a court-yard palace, and before the cloister was built, access to the cemetery was gained through the Eastgate street-front to the east of the Deanery. Although this will have been a relatively minor gate to the cemetery, which was probably entered principally from the west, the property which incorporated the access is described as being ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáin the corner‰Û¡ÌÝå» (of the then Close), suggesting that the cemetery extended eastwards to the upper city wall, or what was left of it once the Chapter House had been built across its line. Although an extensive area, the burials contained in the atrium are of especial significance to our understanding of the development of the city. Now that the central area of St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s has been excavated (RAZ 8.8.1, 9.60.29), a dated burial sequence from the Cathedral graveyard, indicating both when burial here started and the fluctuations in its use, will provide critical information for our understanding of the development of the upper city in the post-Roman period. Furthermore, over time, an understanding of the spatial patterns of use within this huge graveyard through time will help us understand the development of the church in Lindsey and the Leicester/Lincoln diocese through the Anglo-Scandinavian period. It is also possible that the graveyard will contain the remains of small churches and perhaps other features, such as grave-yard crosses, erected in association with burial rites, as ancillary buildings to St Mary of Lincoln. It is also likely that it will contain important evidence for the styles and rituals associated with burials here in this critical period for the development of Christianity in the region. We do not know, either, what sort of accommodation was provided for the clergy in the pre-Conquest period, and it is likely that important remains of domestic buildings will survive - perhaps on the fringes of the RAZ. These structures will offer the opportunity of comparison between the standards of living of the Minster clergy and the secular inhabitants of sites like Flaxengate (F72 - RAZ 9.24 and 9.25). In the Anglo-Norman period, and right up to the end of the Era, the burial space available in the cemetery was being curtailed by domestic buildings, along Eastgate, the Bail and even the narrow strip of land against the south wall of the upper city. The research value of these buildings themselves is considered more fully in RAZ 9.28, but here we should investigate what, if any provisions were made for clearing the underlying burial ground before any houses were built. The attitude of the house-builders to the remains of the dead in the cemetery will",Summary,"The boundaries of the RAZ will alter with time, as encroachment on to the cemetery took place continuously from its first establishment until the late 13th century. Initially, however, we might speculate that the boundaries of the Minster atrium lay along the south side of the east-west Roman road which preceded Eastgate (on a different line) and along the east side of the north-south Roman road (close to the line of medieval and modern Bailgate). Consequently, these are the boundaries selected for the RAZ. This means that the RAZ also includes the church and cemetery of All Saints-in-the-Bail (RAZ 9.60.30) and it will be an important aim of research in this area to establish whether this church and cemetery began life as a subsidiary church within the churchyard of St Mary, or whether this graveyard population was always distinct, as it was following the Conquest.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.63,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.63,
d82a2e29-2b68-4b60-b375-f626f3836c32,LARA RAZ AREA,,Thorngate Castle,"The mysterious ""castellum ... de Tornegat"" occurs just twice in documents; once certainly in a document of 1141 (ed. Foster 1931, 61, RA99) and then, perhaps, in a document of 1151 (Ibid., 287-9). Foster thought that it was located just outside the south-east corner of the lower city, but Sir Francis Hill made a case that the site was represented by the later Manor House of the Kyme family, Kyme Hall (Hill 1948, 159-60). Professor Cameron prefers to locate Kyme Hall in Hungate, thereby distinguishing it from Thorngate Castle (1985, 150). Dr Vince makes a third proposal (chapter 9a), that the castle might have been on the actual island of Thorngate in the River Witham. Without further excavation, it is hard to see how this issue will be progressed. The date and fleeting references to the castle suggested to Foster that it was a castle of the Anarchy period, but it is not impossible that it was a foundation of more substance, and should be considered similar to establishments like Mountfitchet and Baynard Castles in London (Watson 1992). That is to say it could have been a private castle held by a major noble who was not part of the official power structure in the county. In this case Foster shows that it would have been the holding of the Condet family (ed. Foster 1931, 282-95). These observations merely emphasise what an interesting structure this castle would be, if it could be located. Thorngate Castle is an important component of the townscape which needs to be located and investigated as a matter of urgency.",Summary,"Given the uncertainty in locating the site, the RAZ is drawn to include both the site to the east of the city ditch at the point at which it joins the Witham and the site to the west, as well as the whole of the suspected island of Thorngate.

d8865049-6a3a-45e2-bc92-a6fae334b572,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Sincil Bank North Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSincil Bank North is an urban, residential Character Area with a grid-iron street pattern of Late Victorian/Edwardian (1868-1918) red brick terraced houses, the majority of them situated at the back of the footway. Most of the current townscape was built over a period of around 50 years from the late 1860s onwards. This gives the Character Area a strong uniformity of form throughout. The earliest housing development in the Character Area which is still visible in the current townscape took place at the southern end of Canwick Road in the 1840s when numbers 119, 123 and 125 were built. This was followed by development on Sincil Bank opposite Monson Street in the 1860s. There are variations in the level and style of detailing on houses, for example plain stone lintels, moulded brickwork and bay windows, although identical and similar versions of these elements are often repeated throughout the Character Area. The houses themselves have a vertical emphasis with narrow fronts and tall windows; however, the repeated form of the terraced house gives a horizontal emphasis to the area accentuated by the continuous line of the eaves and roof ridges. Large numbers of replacement doors, roofs and windows have been fitted and a more recent trend of increasing ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápersonalisation‰Û¡ÌÝå» of houses by painting, harling and application of stone cladding have affected the rhythms of architectural form and detail along the streets. The streetscape is generally cluttered with wheelie bins, cars parked along the narrow streets, and footways and satellite dishes on the street elevations of houses. There are small shops scattered throughout the Character Area but there is no obvious neighbourhood centre or focal point. The carriageway arches, which are still visible in many places giving access to the rear of plots, may be evidence of earlier small-scale industry to the rear of some houses. Sincil Dyke is the only area where there is a sense of open space and the lack of visible greenery along the streets contributes to the urban feel of the Character Area. Very heavy traffic along Canwick Road creates high levels of noise and pollution in that part of the Character Area and acts as a barrier to movement to the east. There are no road links to the north or south except for those via Canwick Road and there are also limited pedestrian connections. A key characteristic of the area is that it is largely cut-off from the city centre and areas to the south and east. However, pedestrian and road links to High Street to the west are good. The back of footway buildings and continuous building line and height give a good sense of enclosure throughout the Character Area and the regularly spaced door and window openings provide active frontages throughout. The small urban blocks allow ease of movement within the Character Area. There are some infill developments in different styles to the rest of the Character Area and set further back than the majority of the rest of the buildings. Three storey end-of-terrace buildings mark some corners and there is a three storey terrace on Portland Street with a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágrander‰Û¡ÌÝå» street front. There are good views of the Cathedral to the north and the north escarpment, and good views of the south escarpment and of landmark buildings to the west along some streets.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 63,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,72,

d8b6e3f9-f174-4461-9cf2-661fc180483b,LARA RAZ AREA,,Cathedral graveyard south-east of Angel Choir,"In the second half of the 13th century the Dean and Chapter relocated their cemetery from the west and north-west of the Cathedral to the area south of the new Angel Choir (Jones et al., 1987, 5). The land was acquired about 1264 and became (as one might expect) a burial ground used especially by the clerical elite (Stocker 1985a). Although the burials here suffered from road works in the 1880s, nevertheless parts of the graveyard survive in excellent condition and provide an important population for the study of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s clerical elite. The burials will also be useful because of the cemetery‰Û¡ÌÝå»s known date of inauguration - all burials here will be later than 1264 - and this will prove useful for the precise dating of any artefacts deposited with the burials. Patterning within the graveyard is also an issue. Preliminary excavations here showed a clustering of the burials close to the south-east transept and the suggestion was made that this was caused by a desire for burial either close to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáshrine‰Û¡ÌÝå» of Bishop Grosseteste or to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáJudgement Porch‰Û¡ÌÝå». Investigations in the remainder of the graveyard should be aimed at recovering information about preferences of burial location.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include the whole of the area presumed to have been occupied by the graveyard (although its precise boundaries are not documented).

d919d101-1a87-4486-b6ca-e3fa68fb22c8,LARA RAZ AREA,,Local roads,"It is thought unlikely that the roads east and west of the lower city (the roads leading into Clasketgate gate and Newland Street West from the water-meadows to east and west of the city) were used by any but local traffic within the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s suburbs and between the suburbs and the fields beyond. This does not mean, however, that the roads in these directions are not of interest. Monks Road (leading due east from Clasketgate gate) led directly to the Monks Leys estate and the sequence of its repair, use and abandonment will chart the litigious relationship which the city authorities had with the Monks of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s York in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and with their secular successors in the later 16th century. This route is also of great importance in understanding the character of, and variations in, the commercial traffic on the Witham, as it will have been one of the routes by which boats unloaded at ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáBlackdyke‰Û¡ÌÝå» and its related installations (RAZ 9.2, RAZ 10.2) would have entered the city centre. Parallel with Monks Road, running along the cliff top there was also a local road on the line of Lindum Terrace (probably called 'Wintergate' - Cameron 1985, 110). Dr Vince has shown that this road was also medieval in origin and would have given access, not only to the city fields, but also to some of the more prominent wells along the cliff edge, such as the Wainwell and probably to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s east mills (RAZ 9.44, RAZ 10.44). This road was joined at the Wainwell by a road which once led directly to the east gate, but it was bisected by the advance of the stone quarries and by the construction of the Close wall in the late 13th century. This road was originally known as Wainwellgate, but the fragments of it which remained after its truncation by the wall and the quarries became known (eventually) as Winnowsty Lane and Sewell Road (see maps 9/61A, 9/61B and 9/92. These dated interruptions may prove useful dated horizons in any road surfaces, and we would be interested in whether or not these interruptions effectively closed the road, or whether the route was considered to be sufficiently important for new diversions to be found. Once through the suburb, the central of the three roads which ran west through Newland (now Newland Street West) may have been an intermediate route way (RAZ 10.12.2), but as its fellows to the north (Long Leys Road/West Parade) and south (Carholme Road) seem to have led to Burton and Torksey respectively, it is perhaps likely that Newland Street West led only to the agricultural lands on West Common. Information about the development of these routes may help in understanding changes in the use of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s fields; for example, any change from arable in the 13th century to pasture in the 14th or 15th centuries might be visible in the pattern of surfacing.",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries for all of these roads have been drawn to include a 10m margin along either side of the modern roads. Where the medieval road line is thought to depart from the modern, the RAZ is broadened to 50m to ensure that any alternative phases of alignment are detected.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.12.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.12.3,

To the west the boundary is formed by the rear plot boundaries of numbers 9-23 Croft Street and by Coningsby Street. To the east the boundary is formed by property boundaries on Bentinck Street and Bentinck Square and the western boundary of 143 Winn Street. The Character Area includes Cannon Street, Stamp end, Fenton Place, Lytton Street, Bentinck Street, Bentinck Square, Napier Street, Welbeck Street and the south sides of Winn Street and Croft Street.Stamp End is a mainly residential Character Area of apartment blocks constructed in a Modernist style during the 1960s. There is little or no detailing on facades and most buildings have flat roofs with no chimneys. Construction materials are red, brown and yellow brick with some rendered panels. The public/private boundaries are the building facades and this, combined with many open grassed areas, provides a lack of enclosure in the Character Area. Blocks are large with unclear permeability. There are areas of derelict land, car parks facing on to streets and poor car parking and garage areas. There are few areas of continuous building lines and no clear plot structure. The small area of 1930s housing on Bentinck Square is of a more traditional form with clearly-defined plot structure and public/private boundaries. Croft Street Community Centre and the local shops on Baggholme Road form a focal point.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 61,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,60,

d9400236-9a12-4784-b9c9-57132797e619,LARA RAZ AREA,,The defences,"One of the most effective ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» gestures a city can make is to provide itself with the faÌÎå_ade of a defensive wall. Even so motives can be mixed; in the upper city the former fortress wall would have been a potent symbol for the newly arrived colonists of the power of the Roman Army, which they represented directly. The wall itself could be conceived as representing the colonia to the outside world, much as it had previously represented the military power of Rome. In the 1st and 2nd centuries this effect may have been officially sanctioned, as only colonia were permitted to have walls at all (Millett 1990, 137-8). In other words the need to construct walls was initially conceived purely as a demonstration of status, not as a military necessity. Furthermore, if it were indeed the case that the colonists were expected to act as a volunteer reserve, this military display may not have been merely an empty gesture. An alternative, or perhaps an additional, symbolic message might have been intended through comparison between the Roman defences and the surviving LPRIA ditch system, through gaps in which one would have approached the walls of the upper city (RAZ 6.19; 7.25). The latter provided only a symbolic barrier whereas the former provided a barrier which was both symbolic and functional. As a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» monument the various repairs and alterations documented by Mr Jones (1980) tell an ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáofficial‰Û¡ÌÝå» story of the fluctuations in civic prestige throughout the Roman period; documenting this ‰Û¡ÌÝÌástory‰Û¡ÌÝå» through adequate stone-by-stone recording and subsequent phasing of the accessible walls, should be undertaken as soon as possible. Such work must, in any case, be included within the scope of future consolidation programmes. The gatehouses, as the foci of these symbolic messages deserve particular attention. At Lincoln they are particularly bombastic; three huge gatehouses surround an upper city where the intramural area was very small by continental standards. The gates of the lower city, however, stand in marked contrast. The Park example is small and, if the medieval Clasketgate gate was based on a Roman structure, it too was of a smaller scale than those in the upper city. The walled upper city is small compared with other walled cities in Roman Britain (Millett 1990, table 6.4) but it is very small when compared with European and North African cities. Although the upper city at Lindum (450 x 370m) is larger than the large fora enclosures at Palmyra, (250m square) or Trier (250m x 150m), it is similar in size to the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáannex‰Û¡ÌÝå» which is thought to represent the precinct of the Temple of Claudius at Colchester, and it is only marginally larger than the area enclosed within the walled temple precinct of Sulis Minerva at Bath. These comparisons of size demonstrate that we are not obliged to view the upper enclosure at Lincoln as a conventional urban unit, contemporaries could have drawn comparisons with major temple precincts as easily as with fortified towns. The relatively small size of the walled upper city, along with the overwhelming size of the gatehouses and the relatively large size of the Forum complex itself, might have given the upper enclosure more the feel of a fortified temple precinct than a genuinely urban area. With its potential background as an Iron Age cult site, perhaps we should consider the possibility that the upper enclosure was more similar in character to the walled ‰Û¡ÌÝÌátown‰Û¡ÌÝå» at Bath than it was to Colchester, and Gloucester. Comparison with these other coloniae is obviously important, however, and current interpretations of those sites suggest that the fortresses in these places had developed into genuine urban settlements by the 2nd century.

d945cc32-a191-4b6e-ae11-7cd175a2ed81,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Sherbrooke Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSherbrooke Character Area is an area of entirely residential housing lying on the north escarpment between Monks Road to the south, Tower Drive to the north, and Allenby Road to the east. The area consists of three phases of housing dating to the Late Victorian/Edwardian [1869-1919 AD] and the Inter-War [1920-1948 AD] Periods. There is a constant and fairly steep slope falling from north to south throughout the entire Character Area, giving good views along rooftops towards rural areas along, and at the base of, the south escarpment.Traces of early activity in the area are limited, although Monks Road, which forms the southern boundary of the Character Area, was established during the medieval era, and is named after the nearby Priory cell of St. Mary Magdalene which once owned land within the Character Area. Originally held in common, land was probably enclosed during the Early Industrial [1750-1845 AD] Period, and the northern and southern edges of the Character Area follow the orientation of former field boundaries. The northern boundary of the area, which later became Tower Drive, also follows the route of a long footpath of unknown date that originally joined the east of the city with its rural hinterland. The date of the footpath is unclear, and although it was considerably altered in the late 19th century, a right of way along the part of the escarpment may have previously existed for a long time.During the first stage of residential development, Late Victorian/Edwardian streets were laid out in the east of the Character Area roughly parallel to contemporary housing along Monks Road to 500m west of the Character Area. Later development infilling the area between Late Victorian/Edwardian streets, is of Inter-War date, suggesting that planned development was interrupted by World War I. This may explain the distant location of Late Victorian/Edwardian housing in the Character Area with respect to other contemporary development along Monks Road to the west.Housing in the Character Area fits into three coherent building types, an initial Late Victorian/Edwardian development, a street of Inter-War housing in neo-vernacular style, and subsequent infill of Inter-War housing which appears to incorporate a mixture of the two preceding developments and characteristics of 1930s‰Û¡ÌÝå» housing.Properties have been laid out along Monks Road and Ellesmere Avenue and within a gridiron pattern of short streets orientated north/south up the steepest gradient of the escarpment. The area is divided into small urban blocks defined by regular roads. There is a strong sense of rhythm along streets generated by repeating buildings of the same form and style. There is a medium to high density of housing in the area, which decreases from east to west, and a good and regular sense of enclosure along streets. Properties are two storeys in height and two to three bays in width with active frontages facing the road, and occupy small rectangular plots with their short axis aligned parallel to the road. Late Victorian/Edwardian terraces are built of red Albion brick and are similar in style and form, with shallow-pitched gabled roofs with shallow eaves, plain closed verges and rooflines running parallel to the street. Terraces along Bathurst and Sherbrooke Streets are built in straight rows with properties set at the back of the footway whereas properties facing Monks and Allenby Roads are arranged in a stepped line around the corner, and have small forecourts, small porches and bay windows. Public/private boundaries are defined by low brick walls. Roofs are mostly of concrete or slate tiles, and have brick chimneys with tall pots, which avoid the ridgeline. Houses have medium solid-to-void ratios with large vertical windows, which have thin stone sills and thick stone lintels. Houses along the southern and eastern edges of the Character Area have larger first-floor windows to take advantage of rural views off the escarpment. Front entrances have matching stone lintels above half glazed doors. Windows and doors have been replaced with uPVC substitutes. Properties are quite decorative with moulded and dentilated brickwork beneath the eaves and simple stringcourses joining lintels at ground floor level. ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáNeo-vernacular‰Û¡ÌÝå» properties along Jellicoe Avenue are relatively larger in scale, being semi-detached properties set back 4-6m from the footway with small gardens or driveways defined by low garden fencing or privet hedging. Houses are ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáT‰Û¡ÌÝå» shaped in plan, and arranged in a straight line. Gabled roofs are steeply pitched with deep eaves, shallow plain verges, and are mostly covered with red/brown plain tiles. Chimneys pass through the ridgeline, and are tall plain brick-built stacks with tall ceramic pots. Properties have high solid-to-void ratios, particularly on gable ends facing the street which have fewer windows. Windows are horizontal UPVC casement windows, and are set immediately beneath the eaves line at first-floor level. Doors are located on the front or side of properties and are partially glazed UPVC or wooden replacements, often located beneath shallow overhanging porches.The final stage of development is, in part, an assimilation of parts of the two earlier architectural styles, and the inclusion of characteristics of 1930s‰Û¡ÌÝå» housing. Houses are semi-detached, and have hipped roofs with shallow eaves covered with concrete tiles or slate, and chimneys passing through the ridgeline. Properties are set back 3-6m from the footway with public/private boundaries defined by privet hedges or low brick walls. Houses have medium solid-to-void ratios, with vertical windows, which are mounted high up near the eaves at first-floor level. Windows and doors have large lintels and thin stone sills in stone. Houses have ground floor bay windows, many of which have deep overhanging hipped roofs, next to entrances both to the front and to the side. Properties are generally plain in decoration, although some are rendered with pebbledash and have windows set within brick quoin surrounds.Buildings within all phases of development appear to be close to their original form. A few original elements of the streetscape survive, including York stone kerbing and cast-iron nameplates in places.There is no public, open or green space within the Character Area. Green space is limited and includes some thin grass verges and mature trees along Jellicoe Avenue and Ellesmere Avenue. However, views off the escarpment to the south and east are dominated by Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s rural hinterland.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 49,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,42,

The relative wealth of the parish might, then, have been reflected in the quality of ornament of the church and may also have influenced the apparent large size of its churchyard. As with most of the Lincoln churches the foundation date will be of considerable interest. At present we might take the view that as it is halfway between St Mary-le-Wigford (RAZ 9.60.26) and St Benedict (RAZ 9.60.20) in location, its foundation date should be intermediate between the mid 10th and the mid 11th century as well. This model of the development of the suburb suggests a gradual extension northwards from the higher ground around St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and the alternative, that the extension northwards represents a single act of planning, might imply that St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s foundation should be closer in date to St Benedict‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. The Rectory of St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s seems to have been located immediately south of the churchyard (ed. Major 1968 63-6, RA 2457-9) and it is possible that the building was originally built within the early graveyard. This should be tested and, if it proves to be the case, the sealed burial population should be explored with care - attempting to gather an appropriately large sample of these early burials. As a group this sealed population will make an interesting comparison with any similar sealed group from beneath the prebendal house in the churchyard of St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (RAZ 9.60.21) and from beneath the rectory house at St Mary-le-Wigford (RAZ 9.60.26). The building itself will be of considerable interest and should be compared with other known clergy houses (like those at St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s) as well as with secular examples (RAZ 9.33, RAZ 9.34 etc.)",Summary,The site of the churchyard has been traced through early leases and the RAZ is intended to include the whole of the plot indicated.

d9ac7878-5fae-49fc-aadd-3e559224aa30,LARA RAZ AREA,,"Burial Sites at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, the St Peters' and Greetwell villa","Efforts to understand pre-Viking Lincoln to date have been focused on the excavations at St Paul-in-the-Bail; excavations which have proved intractable of understanding and about which no consensus has yet emerged, or is likely to. Our best route forward may not lie in continual re-examination of the same few items of excavated data but rather in establishing a research agenda which addresses the context in which the site at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s developed. Our first step down this road must be to recognise that we have evidence for two other early Anglo-Saxon burial grounds in Lincoln; at the Greetwell Villa and at Silver Street. Taken as a group some additional reflected light is cast on the individual sites. All seem to represent examples of the same ritual behaviour which has been observed on dozens of other former Roman sites. That is to say, a space was cleared within the ruins of the buildings and a small number of burials were carefully dug into the rubble. This type of early Anglo-Saxon burial is ubiquitous on former villa sites, and it comes as no surprise that it occurs also at the Greetwell Villa, but before we go on to make special claims for the burials at the St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s site we have to ask why we should consider them any differently from those at Silver Street. Quite a lot of study has been accorded this category of Anglo-Saxon burial in recent years and it is clear, for example, that the burials within villas should be compared with burials carefully placed in Neolithic and Bronze Age barrows and in other features of what was to the Anglo-Saxons, their own historic landscape (Williams 1997; Bell 1998). Williams, in particular shows that, whilst this burial behaviour is very deliberate, the wide range of Roman sites selected for reuse as burial grounds makes it unnecessary to imagine that the Roman function of the structure reused influenced its selection as an Anglo-Saxon burial ground. It is the generalised association with previous generations, he argues, which was sought out by the Anglo-Saxons, rather than a specific connections with remembered Roman cult practises. Furthermore, such re-use of Roman monuments can be 5th, 6th, 7th or 8th century in date, so this behaviour cannot be used as a dating mechanism at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. Even so it does indicate that the ruins of Roman Lincoln were not merely abandoned in the Anglo-Saxon period. They may have become a liminal location, between the living and the dead, but they were evidently not without meaning or function. Unfortunately, although it is clear that this burial behaviour indicates a desire to appropriate the ancestors and to ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáimpose a sense of the past‰Û¡ÌÝå» (Williams 1997, 26) on contemporary Anglo-Saxon society, it cannot be said that such burials represent any specific cultic meaning, either pagan in character or Christian. At least one of the Silver Street burials was in a crouched position (Steane and Vince 1993,75), however, so are unlikely to be Christian. It is very tempting to think that, because the Anglo-Saxon burials at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s were made on a site which (according to one view of the sequence) had previously contained a late Roman church, then the burials of the 5th and 6th century here were Christian - keeping the flame alive as it were. However, analyses such as that by Howard Williams would strongly suggest that the Forum space at Lincoln was selected for burials because it was at the centre of the walled Roman enclosure, and because the former Forum was presumably clearer of rubble and offered less intractable soil conditions, rather than because it was known that it was once a church site. And this in its turn also suggests that the burials may have as easily been pagan as Christian, although we must bear in mind that these two terms may not be antithetical. Even though the burials at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s are aligned east-west, this may be because they are aligned with their feet towards the ever-present well head, known to be open in both previous and succeed",Summary,Se RAZ subdivisions,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,8.1,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,8.1,

In the High Medieval Era, however, we can say something more detailed about the activities which went on here. First Dr Vince has shown quite clearly that river fishing, sometimes from boats and sometimes using traps, was an important source of employment and income (chapter 9a). In the 12th-14th centuries fishing from boats seems to have been based along Waterside North, although some fish may have been landed and sold at other quays. The Brayford wetlands provide an environment in which the remains of fish- and eel-weirs, traps and baskets will be preserved and the archaeology of these features in the Anglo-Scandinavian period is not well understood. A useful resume of the topics is in Dyer 1994, 101-111, drawn mostly from documentary sources. Archaeo-zoological evidence indicates that sea fish probably replaced river fish in the diet as the middle ages went on (chapter 9a), and this may imply that fishing became less intensive in the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s wetlands as time went on. We know that water fowl also played an important part in the diet and the Brayford wetlands will have been important for this activity also. We have too little information about the percentage of fowl in the diet to understand whether the exploitation of the Brayford wetlands fluctuated. Fowling may have been undertaken with nets, but questions about techniques can be addressed through future archaeological work in this RAZ.In addition to these wetland industries the anaerobic conditions prevailing here mean that the Brayford and its associated wetlands will preserve important archaeo-botanical information, from which a complete environmental history of the area during the medieval period can be produced. Similarly rare and important artefacts of wood, leather and other organic materials may be preserved, and any works on the riverbed must be fully sieved under archaeological supervision. Previous finds in the wetland have included the valuable and important hoards of early metalwork (including metalwork of the High Medieval Era - Stocker and Everson 2003) in the vicinity of the Stamp End causeway, and further finds of this type should be expected.",Summary,The RAZ boundaries follow the edges of waterlogged ground below the 5m. contour.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.7,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.7,

db801382-6688-4e62-9bdd-d053ea1129c9,LARA RAZ AREA,,Lincoln Castle from c.1350-c.1750,"As well as the forthcoming volume dedicated to the site (ed. Lindley forthcoming), a Conservation Plan has been produced for Lincoln Castle (Hayfield 2000) and this provides a much more detailed research agenda than is possible here. The following supplementary information is provided to help guide future archaeological planning. One of the remarkable things about Lincoln Castle is the way in which its development seems to have been arrested, following the major re-fortification in the 13th century. We know of almost no works undertaken on the defences after that date - indeed the earliest topographical views (Buck of the 1720s) show an enclosure and towers in an advanced state of ruin, much more ruined than appears the case today following 19th-century reconstruction. Yet we know that the Castle was besieged in May 1644 and that the enclosure itself continued to be the headquarters of the administration of the County throughout the Early Modern Era. The archaeology, then, should cast light on two different aspects of the castle‰Û¡ÌÝå»s history - the short term military events of the 1640s and the long-term activity connected with County administration and justice.We have an account of the siege of May 1644 in contemporary newspapers and they make it clear that the castle itself was fitted out for defence, presumably with earthworks and temporary wooden barriers being lodged around and against the stonework. The archaeological remains of these temporary fortifications will be of great interest to military historians. It has been speculated that, in the aftermath of the Civil War, the castle may have been deliberately slighted. There is no documentary evidence for this, but archaeological evidence may throw light on the question.The Castle ditches, which had formed a key part of the defences of the site in the Early Modern Period, evidently fell out of use and were considered dispensable by the reign of Charles I, when they were sold off in plots for houses. We need to know whether this sell-off represented a single act of state privatisation, made simply to raise revenue for the crown, or whether it represented a recognition of the status quo, which would suggest that only feeble control had been kept of state property in preceding years - unofficial privatisation by stealthy local initiative.Although the Civil War was a major interruption, the processes of County justice and administration continued here from c.1350-c.1750. It was focused on the twin halls within the enclosure, neither of which has been investigated archaeologically; both represent enormous resources of information for understanding the development of County administration and justice. One aspect of this function, amongst others, which we know will be of great interest, is the development of prison regimes. Very little is known about the circumstances in which prisoners were held awaiting trial in the late medieval period. What was the physical layout of detention blocks, was there segregation and if so was it by class or sex or both? In the 18th century more is known and the documentation suggests that several dedicated units developed within the castle enclosure, for criminals awaiting trial, for debtors and for the condemned awaiting execution. All details of these regimes will be welcome, but, if possible, comparative studies between the different categories of incarceration will be of great interest. In addition to these functional buildings there is known to have been a suite of residential buildings for the Constable and other visiting officials. These buildings were a legacy of the High Medieval Era, but alterations made throughout the Early Modern Era will be of interest in charting the interest taken in the administration of justice in successive regimes.",Summary,The boundary of the RAZ remains as in RAZ 9.48.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.48,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.48,

dc05456e-f681-4f5f-b7a7-6fbd6360f255,LARA RAZ AREA,,Land around city potentially usable for settlement and agriculture,"We have no information at all about the use to which the land surrounding the city was put in the Early Medieval Era. Obviously the high heath lands north of the walled enclosure would provide good grasslands for grazing and may even have been ploughed. The heavier silts and clays in the valley bottom would be less useful for arable, but the meadows east and west of the walled enclosure would produce good seasonal grazing for cattle. The woodlands in the Birchwood and Boultham Moor areas would still be available, although we have no evidence that the Romans‰Û¡ÌÝå» extensive exploitation of this resource continued under their successors. The Anglo-Saxon culture, however, was very much at home with woodland management and exploitation and so it is unlikely that such a valuable resource would have been abandoned. Furthermore the enigmatic discovery of an Anglo-Saxon pot within the flue of one of the abandoned Rookery Lane pottery kilns at least shows activity in the area (Webster 1960; Eagles 1979, 156,377) even if it does not show continuity. Evidence for early and middle Saxon utilisation of these is woodland resources is likely to exist, and, although it may be hard to find, it will be especially valuable when recovered. Even with the known rise in water levels in the Early Medieval period, the flat gravel terraces either side of the Witham above Bracebridge will have remained highly favourable to settlement, as they were in earlier eras, although there is no evidence for early medieval settlement here at present. It has been suggested on several occasions (most recently and fully by Kevin Leahy (1993)), that there was a qualitative difference between early Anglo-Saxon settlement around Lincoln and that which was experienced elsewhere in the county. Commentators have pointed to the apparent ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhole‰Û¡ÌÝå» in the distribution of cremation cemeteries around the city (the nearest known sites are no closer than 20 miles in any direction) and suggested that this gap in the distribution represents a community, based on the city, which did not subscribe to the prevailing burial customs of the in-comers. This might, it is argued, represent evidence for a surviving Romano-British enclave based in the city - perhaps an outpost of sub-Roman Christianity. The only tangible evidence for this community so far, however, is the material from St Paul-in-the-Bail and we have seen (above) that this will as easily sustain interpretation as representing a pagan community as a Christian one. Furthermore, the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhole‰Û¡ÌÝå» in the distribution pattern might be more apparent than real, and it was reported that cremations were discovered during the salvage recording at the Greetwell Villa in the 1880s (RAZ 8.1.3) although the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáhole‰Û¡ÌÝå» is still evident in the distribution of cremation cemeteries, and the recent discoveries of scatters of early-Anglo-Saxon pottery at Middle Carlton and Cherry Willingham (both about 5 km from the city centre -Vince and Young 1991-4; Williams and Vince 1997) suggest that there were settlements much closer to the city. These communities used the same pottery types as those used in the cremation cemeteries and it may be that cremation cemeteries have gone under the plough without adequate record.",Summary,The RAZ boundaries are taken from those of the preceding Era,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,8.4,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,8.4,

It is behind Rookery Lane along the street called Grainsby Close. It is arranged around a central green and, to that extent, is planned as a self-contained community. But one of the interesting contrasts between this development and the contemporary building at Swanpool (RAZ 11.29.1) and St Giles is that the houses are ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádetached‰Û¡ÌÝå» and in their own individual plots. We should explore the extent to which this ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáindividuality‰Û¡ÌÝå» has contributed to the relative success of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápre-fab‰Û¡ÌÝå» when compared with the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásemi-detached‰Û¡ÌÝå» or ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáterrace block‰Û¡ÌÝå» layout of the two larger estates.

ddba707d-1ff4-4320-a739-fff7f7dbb443,LARA RAZ AREA,,Tilery in St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish,"The earliest references to the existence of a tile-house south of St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s church are 12th-century in date (RAZ 9.40.2) (pers. com. CPC Johnson - citing references in Survey of Lincoln archive). The site continues to be well-documented in the city records (as a property belonging to the City Council) until it was, apparently, demolished in the 1670s (Cameron 1985, 158-9). Through this long period, however, activity may not have been intensive, as only two tilers are mentioned in the Warden‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Accounts (Bischoff forthcoming). Even so, although not an intensive operation, the kiln was long-lived, and this allows us to study the long-term development of the technologies of brick-production as recommended by Angela Simcoe (1998).The site offers exceptional evidence, then, for the development of this specialised industry over a period of at least 500 years and this makes it a site of great importance. The site is likely to preserve not just kilns but also the clay-mills, drying sheds and other ancillary buildings which have been so rarely investigated in previous excavations that have concentrated on the kilns themselves. A full research agenda for the tile industry is provided by Simcoe (Ibid.). Our identification of sources of clay digging on the South Common south of the St Botolph kiln site (RAZ 9.41.1 and 10.41.1) has raised the possibility that these kilns were, to some extent, public facilities, established to service ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácommon diggings‰Û¡ÌÝå» on the Common. It may be, for example, that tenants were under an obligation to burn tiles and bricks at the request of freemen, and the surviving documentation should be searched with such questions in mind. A need to retain some level of public provision would explain, for example, why the site remained a City Council property, and why (by the early 18th century) there was an office of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácity brick-maker‰Û¡ÌÝå» even though by this time he was, apparently, not working at St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (Hill 1956, 211). The archaeological remains of the kilns will be of great importance in their own right, but the possibility that we may learn something about the public provision of such facilities makes them of exceptional interest. This important aspect of the kilns may be best studied, not so much through a study of their products, but through a study of their layout and context. Did any kiln operators live on site? Was the street front on to High Street exploited for tile-related accommodation or was it let off separately with the tile works in the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáback yard‰Û¡ÌÝå»?

It provided a valuable service to the poor who were unable to afford a doctor, treating between 1,500 and 2,000 patients a year but also served as a watchdog for the outbreak of epidemics on the part of the city elite (Beckwith 1990, 98; Hill 1974, 163, 165, 169). Future work on the site should investigate the conversion necessary in the fabric of a residential property to provide a Dispensary. Can the attitude of the Dispensary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s governors to their clients be seen in the way in which they were led around the building? The Cornhill Dispensary was replaced by a purpose-built structure on in Silver Street in 1879 (architects Watkins and Scorer). This is an important building for our understanding of 19th-century health care. It would be valuable to know the principles on which it was designed; once again the attitude of the governors to their clients will be apparent in the layout of the building and perhaps in deposits of finds as well. Results from study of these aspects of the building ought to be compared with results from the Cornhill site to understand how they changed through the 19th century and how they were affected by the growth of the industrial working class. The Silver Street Dispensary was eventually replaced by the Co-operative Stores in 1933 and it moved to Mint Street, where it eventually became the NHS Chest Clinic.",Summary,The RAZ surrounding the Cornhill site is drawn following the property boundaries on the 1842 Padley map.

The former settlement here (RAZ 10.11) seems to have been largely removed in the 19th century as part of the process of laying out the grounds of Boultham Hall, the seat of the Ellison family. It is not clear when this occurred, but the surviving gatehouse lodges are dated 1846. The precise date of the layout of the park and the first house should be sought archaeologically. The grand house, demolished in 1959, was built in 1874 (Elvin 1976, 38), and its plan will be recoverable through excavation. Its site may contain a rich deposit of 19th-century material illustrating the life of the country house, a topic which been of considerable interest in recent years (Girouard 1979; Airs (ed.) 2000). It may also retain interesting adaptations made during its conversion to a convalescent hospital during the First World War. The parkland and the wider estate centre which replaced the settlement is itself of great interest and efforts should be made to map not just the surviving estate buildings (important though they are) but also the planting, which will allow a reconstruction of the extensive gardens here. A research agenda for this aspect of the site can be extracted from Elliott 1986. These gardens included the extensive lake, which still survives, and the dam of the lake itself and the hydraulic engineering structures which are associated with it are of considerable interest and must be recorded before removal or replacement. We should be aiming at reconstructing these important Victorian gardens on paper, and ensuring that its earthworks, some of which still survive, are adequately recorded. The park also includes the parish church of St Helen, which was extensively rebuilt as a parkland feature (RAZ 11.91.18). Although the house and buildings remained intact, the entire estate was purchased by the City Council in 1929, following which the grounds were laid out as a public park. The remainder of the estate was earmarked for housing, built over the following 40 years. Between the wars, then, Boultham offers an example of the break-up of private property and its return to the public domain after a century in private hands. The houses form part of RAZ 11.31.",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the area of the former park of Boultham Hall, which was much more extensive than the former village had been, as depicted on the 1st edition O.S. map, and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.2,

Dr Vince has shown us (chapter 9a) that in its first phase of development the suburb probably only extended as far south as the boundary ditch called the Great Gowt. It is possible that in origin the Great Gowt is a natural feature, although it was clearly heavily modified already by the 18th century. Our understanding of the date and character of the early stages of Wigford would be greatly enhanced if we could understand at what stage the Gowt became a formal boundary. It is important that, here, a long section is taken, which includes substantial stretches of land on either side. As the ditch is wet it will also be an important site for paleo-environmental samples, and the deposits adjacent to the modern dyke may offer important insights into the development of the lower city generally. Without excavation, however, important results may be obtainable simply by careful recording during repairs to the Gowt‰Û¡ÌÝå»s sides. In particular we want to know whether or not the channel did have its origin in a natural water course and, if so, by what steps and when it was converted to serve as an urban boundary. We should bear in mind the possibility that this original boundary had an earthwork bank on its inside, ie, north, and, perhaps, a timber palisade. At both western and eastern ends it is likely that there will be structural timbers from weirs and other water control features which should be recorded in situ and then sampled for dendrochronology. The Little Gowt may also have started life as a natural watercourse, and its role in the early boundary system is simply not understood. We need to know its origins and why it survived as a long-term feature in the urban topography.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include the modern line of both Gowts and to include a 10m strip of land either side to allow the modern dyke to be seen within the context of the broader water course in which it may originate.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.51.4,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.51.4,

Attempting to establish where any such settlement was, and what character any such settlement had, is clearly an important priority for future research. At present the indications are that occupation of some type existed on the brow of the hill at the very angle where the cliff turns from approximately east-west to approximately north-south. Here a few sherds of early Anglo-Saxon pottery were discovered in excavations at the Lawn (L86), and here also a larger quantity of Middle Saxon wares probably indicate a small settlement of some type. Further work needs to be done on these valuable pottery sherds. Dr Vince has shown (Vince and Young 1991-4; Williams and Vince 1997) that the early Anglo-Saxon pottery belongs to a distribution pattern of pottery fabrics produced in north-west Leicestershire and which are found in a distribution pattern which nearly coincides with the Roman territory of the Corieltauvi. Whatever significance is read into this remarkable co-incidence, pottery of this type seems to be primary evidence for the persistence of a cultural unit, and presumably some type of political entity, facilitating regional trade, that persisted into the 6th century. However, Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work shows - equally clearly - that in the 7th century this pattern breaks down, pottery from north-west Leicestershire disappears and is replaced by more locally made fabrics. However, it also seems to be the case that middle-Saxon pottery types in Lincoln are not comparable with those found along the coast of Lindsey. These differences in pottery type, however, are not thought to represent differences in character of occupation; similar scatters elsewhere in the county indicate small farming units, but here outside the Roman west gate the scatter may indicate a different type of site. Dr Vince believes that the contrast between this scatter and the types of pottery found inside the walls is significant and could represent different types of occupation (see RAZ 8.3.4 below). The scatter outside the walls could, for example, represent a periodic meeting place associated with activity of a different character inside the walls. Lincoln then, may be the focal point for a small territory in the middle-Saxon period, but it seems it was not yet predominant over the whole of Lindsey. Our dating of the burials at St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and Silver Street is not detailed enough for us to be certain which of these pottery-using groups were responsible for the burials at these sites, although the recovery of single sherd of the earlier pottery type from St Paul‰Û¡ÌÝå»s might encourage the view that the burials were not initiated here by the Middle Saxon pottery users in the 7th century.Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work shows that even single sherds of Early or Middle Saxon pottery can be of great significance and even small quantities require extended research programmes. The collection of pottery in this RAZ should be regarded as a high priority.",Summary,"The RAZ boundary is drawn to include the full extent of the scatter, which is presumed to have been focused around the west gate of the former Roman enclosure. The single sherd found at Langworthgate is excluded as it is presumed to be an erratic , but it is not impossible that an area of scattered settlement of some type extended as far east as this.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,8.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,8.2,

This means that the fabric itself offers an opportunity to investigate adaptations to serve new and revived rituals of the 19th century, and the understanding of these should form part of future research designs. In 1877 the church was considerably enlarged with the addition of a south aisle (to designs by Mr Leach - a Cambridge architect), a sure sign of an expanding population within the parish at this time. The churchyard continued to be used for interments up until the 1850s, and burials from this graveyard will be particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered a deterioration in their circumstances. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city.

e03d3098-9313-4f20-a311-c0fd548aedda,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Tentercroft Street Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌTentercroft Street Character Area is characterised by great diversity, both in the structure of the townscape and in the use of land and buildings within it. The incoherent character of the area is partly as a result of the its separation from the surrounding townscape by the construction of the railways in 1846 and 1848, and subsequent re-development during the 20th century, especially following the decommissioning of the Midland Line in 1985. Although adjacent to the High Street, the Character Area remains largely divorced from the wider townscape. It is defined by the rear of properties that face High Street to the west and the mostly impermeable boundaries to the north, south and east.Evidence for the former railway is still observable in the townscape, particularly in the east where original railings and coping are still visible in situ, and where overgrown shrubs and trees mark the direction of the former main line. Modern [1967-2008] buildings to the south, including the Magistrates‰Û¡ÌÝå» Court, mark the route of the former line as it approached High Street. The division of land and setting out of road infrastructure shortly after the arrival of the railways was also influenced by the existing medieval field structure, the orientations of which remain preserved in the current townscape.Surviving Victorian buildings are of varying form and style, and are entirely located along Tentercroft Street, a road laid out parallel to the Great Northern Line in response to rapid growth that came with the railways. Properties of this Period are two-storey detached and semi-detached houses which maintain the alignment of buildings on the junction of Tentercroft Street with High Street. Modern buildings, though similar in height, are squatter in proportion, occupying large segregated plots incorporating extensive car parking. The townscape is disjointed, reflected in the varying size of blocks, inconsistent public/private boundaries, and a differing sense of enclosure. Several buildings along Tentercoft Street, in particular the Victorian buildings, show evidence of alteration as a result of changes in use.Land use in the area is mixed and is frequently of a kind more associated with peri-urban areas (i.e. on the outskirts of town). Vehicular access to the area is confined to Tentercroft Street, and is predominantly associated with use of the car park, which dominates a large extent of the area, and has a long history of remaining as an open space despite peripheral development. However, despite generally impermeable boundaries and unkempt areas, Tentercroft Street Character Area is an important thoroughfare for pedestrians travelling between High Street, residential areas to the south east, and the railway station to the north.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 42,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,67,

e1851aed-9952-424d-b5b5-ee83167eb6dc,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Witham East Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Witham East Character Area is a transitional area on the eastern edge of Lincoln, between the built-up area of the city and its rural surroundings. It contains aspects that are characteristic of the industrial areas on the eastern side of the city and aspects that are more characteristic of rural areas to the east beyond the city boundary.It is situated on the floodplain between the north and south escarpment, in the river valley. The area is predominantly flat but rises to the north and south on the lower slopes of the escarpments.It is primarily a 19th-century drained agricultural landscape of enclosed arable fields, grazed meadow and pasture, course unmanaged wetland and land recently infilled with refuse, plus one arable field on higher ground to the north.The River Witham, with its two parallel catchwater drains known as North and South Delph, runs through the area from east to west, separated by two strips of grassland. Water is a prominent feature in the Character Area and something that has heavily influenced its character in terms of the wetland conditions it has created, as a natural corridor for wildlife and as part of the drainage works.Railway infrastructure from the mid-late nineteenth century cuts across the Character Area from east to west, marginalising it from neighbouring areas to the north and south. During the High Medieval Era [850-1350 AD] land to the north of the river was permanent pasture. South of the river, the land was part of a large open common belonging to Canwick village. This area was probably enclosed during the Early Industrial [1750-1845 AD] Period. Land to the south of the river was held in common until the enclosure of the majority of common lands in the Canwick Parish by an Act of Parliament in 1787. However, much of the wetter land bordering the river remained as wetland until after the drainage works of the 19th century.The river was canalised and delph drains were constructed as part of a series of engineering works carried out in the Early Industrial Period to improve drainage. It is likely that land either side of the newly embanked watercourses was improved and enclosed shortly after the engineering works. Many of the field boundaries and drains associated with the drainage and division of land survive in the modern landscape.During the mid to late 19th century, several railway lines were constructed through the Character Area. These were catalysts for Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economic growth during the Post-Railway Expansion [1849-1968 AD] and Late Victorian/Edwardian [1868-1919 AD] Periods. A wide tarmac footpath on the embankment between the river and South Delph marks the route of a railway line which was decommissioned in 1971. During the Post-War and Modern Periods, the majority of land in the Character Area has remained agricultural in character, partly as a result of the fact that the railways and waterways have marginalised it from adjacent areas of the city. Its position in the floodplain of the river and the barriers to access created by the railway lines mean that the area has not been heavily developed.Access and permeability is limited. The railway lines along the northern and southern boundaries of the Character Area enable people to arrive and depart from the city centre but bypass the area itself and prevent access to the area from north and south. The river and adjacent cycle track provide access from east to west for boats, cyclists and walkers but there are very limited crossing points over the river and drains, preventing movement north-south through the area. However, this east-west route is important for integrating city and countryside, enabling people to move quickly and easily between the two. There are linear views along the watercourses and along the cycle path, and views on to neighbouring industrial units off Spa Road and Allenby Road, and agricultural and grassland areas to the south and east through the Witham Gap. There are also longer views towards the north escarpment, with the Cathedral and industrial foreground, and the south escarpment including Canwick Golf Course. The electricity pylons and cables that criss-cross the area have an impact on many of these views, particularly those to the east.

Even though remains of this Era have been severely damaged by later terracing, the effort of trying to trace them is still worthwhile. It will be valuable to understand how early the folly of trying to create a straight road directly uphill from the causeway began.

e3ab0f14-38a3-4ddc-820c-74b78b9427fe,LARA RAZ AREA,,The wetlands,"The wetlands in the valley bottom were dramatically altered during the Industrial Era, and the important public resource which they had formerly represented was finally lost to private ownership. Between 1804 and 1816 much of the land south of the Fossdyke and Brayford Pool was drained by Lord Monson, who then enclosed the land and established tenant farmers. This process has its own archaeology; there is some interest in the type of land drains used and where they were made. Some of the new dykes and quickset hedges still survive and give this area its modern rural character. Farm sites, such as Haw Hill Farm, have now mostly been abandoned, but they merit recording as examples of dated enclosure farms which will exemplify the progress of agricultural improvement at the turn of the 19th century. These sites should be comparable with Hartsholme Farm, Oak Farm and Swanpool Farm and should also be compared and contrasted both with more complex farms of the Stone‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Place type (RAZ 11.12; 11.15.2; 11.17) and with the enclosure farms created in the Lincoln city fields in 1803. The Old Decoy marked on early maps (e.g. OS of 1824) lies in the modern Skellingthorpe parish, but it probably supplied Lincoln with water fowl. Nevertheless it is possible that some of the other pools in the wetlands (Cuckoo Pool and Swanpool or their predecessors?) have their origins in decoys. When mapped in 1779 (Armstrong‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map) they both had extensions that might have had their origins in the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápipes‰Û¡ÌÝå» needed for a true decoy to function (of the type introduced from Holland in the 16th or 17th centuries - Dennison 1998). We have too little information about the percentage of fowl in the Lincoln diet to understand whether the exploitation of the Brayford wetlands fluctuated. In the Industrial Era, however, such decoys were run as industrial concerns and the birds were frequently shipped long distances to markets in the new industrial cities. This being the case we should be interested in evidence for the industrialisation of the decoy, which might, for example, be provided by upgraded communications between the decoy and the railheads. Improvement of the wetlands to the east of the city probably occurred during the river drainage works undertaken in the last two decades of the 18th century, although it may have only been effective following works under the Witham Drainage Act of 1812 (Hill 1974, 96-8). Again there is some interest in the artefacts of drainage employed, such as pipe-work. Attention should be also given to the points at which the new dykes intersect with the course of the Witham itself as this is where any machines designed to lift the water will have been located. Once drained, however, this area became improved pasture and, as it had been rich seasonal grazing before (RAZ 10.7; 10.8.4), its function may not have changed greatly. An important area of wetland remained to the east of the city, even after the river was canalised. This was a seasonal pasture known as Canwick Ings, which was subject to winter flooding (Mills 2001b). This area remained Common after the enclosure of Canwick parish in 1787. There were some sporadic attempts to drain these lands systematically, using pumps to bring water up and into the river channel. The remains of structures connected with this drainage will be of considerable interest and should be used to assist understanding of the process of drainage work here.In addition to providing evidence for the wetland industries, the anaerobic conditions prevailing here means that the Brayford and its associated wetlands will preserve important archaeo-botanical information, from which a complete environmental history of the area can be produced. Such remains may well terminate in the early 19th century with the drainage, and the drainage of the land may have affected the remains of earlier periods adversely, but even so archaeo-botanical studies should attempt to carry the environmental history of the",Summary,The boundaries of the RAZ are derived from depictions of the Wetlands in earlier Eras,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.13,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.13,

e3b44015-7279-4cae-b4aa-da6825d6a2fa,LARA RAZ AREA,,St Giles' Hospital,"The documentary sources suggest that St Giles Hospital continued into the late Middle Ages without the major changes in constitution which affected the Malandry and St Bartholomew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. It continued to serve as an infirmary for elderly and sick members of the cathedral community until the Reformation, when, unlike the other Lincoln hospitals it does not seem to have been regarded as a Chantry and, therefore, was not dissolved. According to Sister Elspeth (ed. Page 1906, 233) it continued to be mentioned in the Chapter Acts as a place of refuge for elderly members of the Cathedral community until the 18th century. Although it was not wound up, however, it is certain that the institution will have undergone enormous changes in regime at the Reformation which resulted in its transformation from what had clearly been a conventional medieval hospital to what sounds like an almshouse. This transformation, of both domestic regime and of ritual in the chapel will be detectable archaeologically and will provide a valuable Lincoln case of this direct transformation. The chapel will be a particularly interesting study. Archaeology may be able to suggest whether the parochial responsibilities (cf. RAZ 10.60.7), which the hospital had inherited from the former church of St Giles, were continued in the Late Middle Ages. The layout of the chapel (either ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácollegiate‰Û¡ÌÝå» or ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáparochial‰Û¡ÌÝå» may be of great help here) and it should also include space for the Chantry of Richard of Ravenser, Archdeacon of Lincoln, which was founded here c.1385 (Venables 1887-8, 345). If the chantry can be identified, it will contain important evidence for late medieval obsequies as well as providing a useful dated horizon within the church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s stratigraphy. The site of the chapel alongside Wragby Road is known, and fragments of stone from the ruins were reused in the present boundary walls and possibly in the fabric of the buildings presently occupying the site. Alterations to these buildings should be undertaken under archaeological supervision as even if none of the present fabric is of medieval date, the masonry is of interest and importance in its own right.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the presumed extent of the precinct, whose east, west and south boundaries are known from early mapping, but whose northern boundary is a matter of speculation.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.58,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.58,

e3c87e33-e9a6-4453-abd8-9784293b598f,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Hillside Avenue Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌHillside Character Area is a small residential suburban area dating to the Post-War Period [1946-1966 AD] located on the north escarpment, between Monks Road to the south and a footpath to the north, overlooking the Witham Valley. The style and form of properties is highly coherent throughout the majority of the Character Area.Construction of housing during the Post-War Period has left few traces of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s past, although the orientation of field boundaries associated with the enclosure of land, probably during the Early Industrial Period, are retained in a number of places. In addition, the boundaries of former ironstone extraction sites are partially retained in the north of the Character Area. Long-established routes leading in and out of the city, including a footpath of unknown date and the medieval course of Monks Road, define the northern and southern boundaries of the Character Area respectively.The layout of the townscape and the form of houses are strongly influenced by the gradient of the hill slope, with long curvilinear roads running broadly parallel to the contour lines, and taller faÌÎå_ades on houses on the upslope side of Hillside Avenue. Buildings sit within large rectangular plots and form continuous lines, increasing the feeling of building density along streets. Streets have relatively narrow carriageways with wide verges and pavements, which, alongside a generally low building height and medium to large setbacks, create a feeling of spaciousness. Houses along Monks Road have comparably larger setbacks than those on Hillside Avenue, except for a modern apartment block which is set back 2-3m from the footway.Residential streets and houses in the Character Area have undergone little alteration and remain mostly in their original form. Houses are very similar in scale, form and style. Properties are plain brick detached or semi-detached bungalows, which are two to three bays in width with regular large horizontal or square uPVC windows facing the street. Main entrances are located either to the side or to the front of properties, and are occasionally set within porches, notably along Monks Road. Properties face the road and are rectangular in plan, with a projecting bay to the front or to one side depending in the construction and orientation of the roof. Roofs are gabled or hipped, with shallow eaves and verges. The majority of roofs have concrete tiles, and have small brick chimneys avoiding the ridgeline.Buildings within plots include several small brick-built or wooden single garages at the end of driveways, and some sheds/outbuildings within secure compounds accessed of the footpath in the north west of the Character Area.A number of buildings along Monks Road, including a complex of modern apartment blocks, are larger in scale and more individual in design. The townscape is almost entirely divided up into residential housing plots with large gardens, with the exception of a small number of private compounds in the north west. Public space is limited to streets and footways.There are good views looking over the Witham valley and onto the south escarpment, which are best appreciated from houses. The wide layout of streets and housing may be influenced by the ability of properties to gain clear view to the south.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 31,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,46,

e46f33b0-e313-4be1-bc2a-207d765269c9,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in the Close and Eastgate,"The fate of the ancient Clergy houses within the Close, east of Bailgate, is recorded in great detail in surviving documentation (Jones et al. 1984 (1996). In research terms there is much to be gained from the study of these buildings in the Industrial Era. In particular the impact of the great movements of the day on a remote, but relatively wealthy community can be assessed as a whole. We should be able to document the arrival of the conveniences of modern life; plumbing, piped water, electricity, gas and telephone, and see how the Close compares with the remainder of the city. It would be fascinating to study the patterning with which such services arrived in the Close. Did they flow down through the church hierarchy itself, starting at the Deanery or the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace, or were the individual canons at liberty to make their individual improvements? If so what prompted particular canons to interest themselves in such matters, compared with others? Whereas it is not really relevant in the cases of the working class housing in the Bail, the Close community will have included early motorists and a similar study of the impact of motoring on the Close houses would be interesting.These considerations also apply to the continuing occupation of 17th- and 18th-century houses in Eastgate, outside the Close, in the Industrial Era. Eastgate House was converted into a grand mansion for Alfred Shuttleworth and any evidence for the conversion itself will be most informative. But to the east and north, the new industrial middle classes and their bosses, the factory owners, developed north-eastern Lincoln as a select suburb in the second half of the 19th century (RAZ 11.28).",Summary,The RAZ includes the whole of the Close and an extension to the north-east to include the 17th- and 18th-century buildings on Eastgate.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.27,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.27,

e4b288f3-9820-4566-bb61-20f9e5a40f9e,LARA RAZ AREA,,An early hilltop enclosure?,"In the same way that the proposed location of the original fortress downhill would have been intended to make a powerful political and religious statement, its relocation uphill within a generation probably contained an entirely different political meaning. Consequently, investigation of early military sites in RAZ 6.1 should seek to compare them with the upper fortress which replaced them; not just in terms of the development of military planning, but also as an expression of the developing political and religious relationship between the Romans and the Iron Age population. Central to these political and religious meanings must have been the former use of this prestigious hilltop site. It is suggested in Chapter 5a that there may have been a late Iron Age hilltop enclosure on this promontory site, similar to those enclosures that dominate the Ancaster and Kirmington Gaps. Investigation within RAZ 6.8 is needed to try and establish what structures, if any, the fortress replaced. None of the excavations within the fortress itself has yet yielded any concrete information about the hilltop before the fortress was laid out, and the recovery of information on this point should be a priority within future work. Mr Jones draws attention to the mysterious and poorly understood ditches and other features at the Lawn (L86) site, west of the fortress‰Û¡ÌÝå» western rampart, which were back-filled with dumps of material of legionary date (chapter 6a). Mr Jones favours the view that this area represents the temporary camp occupied by the legionaries who worked on the fortress‰Û¡ÌÝå» construction. This may be true, but it is also possible that some of the earliest features on this site represent earlier activity on the hilltop. If so, we might presume, on the strength of parallels, both that any Iron Age site on the hilltop would have been similar in size to those at Kirmington and Honington, and that it abutted on to the Lawn site. Consequently most of any such site will lie beneath the present Castle, where early Roman finds were made in 1846, and immediately to the north where similar finds were made in 1847-8 and 1910 (Whitwell 1970, 19).",Summary,"This RAZ is bounded by the cliff edge west and south and, approximately, by James Street and the northern fortress wall east and north (see RAZ 5.3).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,6.8,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,6.8,

We might argue that major routeways to places as important to the city as Saxilby and Torksey are more likely to have been established when the city was booming economically, and expanding the reach of its trading connections (i.e. in the High Medieval Era), than during a protracted period of stagnation and decline (i.e. the Early Modern Era). Clearly research here would help our understanding of the development of the city's economy in the High Medieval and Early Modern Eras. Because the channel of the Drain was shifted somewhat in 1804-16, it is possible that the remains of earlier bridges will survive substantially intact below ground level, the former course of the Drain, presumably having been backfilled. Earthwork survey, especially if combined with geophysics, should be able to locate the structure on the ground and, were excavation required, it is possible that an important monument would be revealed, which would give us a clear understanding of the character of High Medieval transport to the west of the city.",Summary,The RAZ is drawn to include the area thought to contain the bridge on the basis of study of the 1803 enclosure map.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.13.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.13.2,

e4c28ffc-f176-4dfb-b8ca-8a258e7a3fb4,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Thorngate suburb,"Dr Vince has emphasised, through the few documentary sources available, that the small natural eyot of Thorngate developed into a minor suburb within the city (chapter 9a). Virtually nothing is known of the suburb beyond what can be gleaned from the few surviving property deeds. These make it clear that the settlement consisted of little more than a single street with properties lining the south side. To the north these properties faced on to a quayside along the south side of the Witham, approximately where the eastern part of Waterside South runs today. The street may have terminated at the gates of the residence, possibly fortified, known as Thorngate Castle (RAZ 9.49) about which nothing is known either. The research issues within this RAZ are also those of the port of Lincoln generally (especially RAZ 9.5). Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s proposal that Thorngate was a natural eyot in origin seems highly likely, but it must have been considerably enhanced by dumping and the construction of artificial waterfronts. Consequently, along the north and west shores of the eyot, there should be a range of early waterfront structures similar to those found on the north side of the river and in Wigford. The sequence of development of these structures will be of fundamental interest to our understanding of the development of the port, and must be compared with the results from the Waterside North excavations in order that relative chronologies can be established.

Further work here should be undertaken where it is clear that deposits survive. All deposits in this RAZ are likely to be of importance because of their waterlogged character, which ensures the survival, particularly, of organic rubbish dumped behind newly constructed waterfronts as make-up. It seems likely that the modern river front is established on the later-medieval line and, furthermore, the small timber-framed buildings which were recorded in early photographs along Waterside North are likely to have been constructed during the Early Modern Era. None of these buildings appears to have been specialised waterfront structures and this implies that the quayside here was not used for large-scale trading activities of the type which would require warehousing. Towards the eastern end of the quay, however, was the Staple Place, first established (presumably) in 1326 as the weigh-beam where the tax on wool for export was paid (RAZ 9.23.2; 10.49). At London, the equivalent structure, in Cornhill, was a very sophisticated, purpose built market hall (Samuel 1989; 1992), and we must ask if any such similar structure existed at Lincoln. As the staple itself was removed to Boston in 1369, it may be that no such purpose-made structures were begun. Even so the archaeology of this specialised form of market is likely to be of very great interest. Was it, for example, established in what had always been open space, or did it occupy a site which had formerly been private property? This area is one of the potential sites for the little-known Kyme Hall, and we must wonder if this earlier structure played any part in housing the staple. Furthermore, once the staple itself had gone, part of the site may have become the site of the Green Dragon. Although it has been harshly reconstructed, this building is one of the most impressive late-medieval timber framed buildings in Lincoln and there is still plenty of information which can be gained from detailed building survey. Such a survey should be an absolute requirement in advance of any repair or maintenance works here and should be directed towards establishing its original function. Could this be another example of the conversion of a public and institutional site (the Staple Place) into a private holding?To the west of High Bridge, there has been little significant archaeological work on the waterfront. We need to know whether the sequence of development of the waterfront here is markedly different from that to the east of High Bridge. In the 12th and 13th centuries, this waterfront may have been industrial rather than commercial, as it adjoined the cloth production quarter and the dyeing and fulling processes. But with the collapse of the industry in the late 13th century this potentially valuable waterfront land would have become available for other mercantile functions. Was the city capable of taking this opportunity for re-development or was its economy too seriously affected by the collapse of the cloth trade for such regeneration schemes to take root? This area is likely to be the most valuable in our assessment of the impact of Lincoln's economic collapse. How long did it take for alternative uses to become established here, and when they did, what type of uses were thought viable? We might even ask whether this waterfront was occupied at all, once the cloth industry had gone. Certainly Speed‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map shows no houses along the waterside here and as late as Padley's map of 1842, parts of the quayside are without buildings and lie within the back yards of properties fronting on to Much Lane and Newland.",Summary,The RAZ follows the same boundaries as RAZ 9.3.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.3,

The form and style of properties is largely coherent throughout the Character Area, but despite being developed in the Post-War Period, houses have many features reminiscent of housing built in Inter-War Period. Properties remain largely in their original form, surviving as an example of residential expansion in Lincoln in the aftermath of the Second World War.The development of the estate has overwritten much of the former landscape, although some elements of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s past use still influence the current townscape. These influences include the orientation of former field boundaries, the medieval route of Greetwell Road, evidence for former quarrying works, and in particular traces and influences of the layout of an informal garden, which surrounded a Late Victorian/Edwardian house in the north east of the Character Area.The layout of residential streets and houses is coherent throughout the Character Area, with properties arranged around relatively narrow roads that form a rough circle and crescents designed to facilitate the movement of vehicles. There is a medium-to-high density of buildings for a suburban area; however, mature trees along many streets diffuse and soften building lines. Houses face the road, and are set back 5-8m from the footway with driveways or small gardens. Properties include semi-detached or short rows of houses arranged in slightly stepped lines within narrow rectangular plots that have their short sides parallel to streets. Public/private boundaries are defined by a variety of materials, the majority of which are typical of fencing for public housing. There is a good sense of enclosure along streets, which is heightened along many roads with mature overhanging trees.The use of similar materials in buildings of a consistent scale throughout the majority of the Character Area results in a largely coherent townscape. Buildings along streets are mostly three bays in width and two storeys in height, with a small number of bungalows located on corners and around small crescents. Properties are built of small-scale materials, with solid walls constructed using a patterned red/brown brick laid in stretcher bond, and clay or concrete tile roofs. A small number of three-storey buildings exist in the area including three Modern brick-built apartment blocks, and two floors of Post-War apartments above a short run of three shops.The style of Post-War houses throughout the Character Area demonstrates a close connection with 1930s ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáneo-vernacular‰Û¡ÌÝå» style. Properties are plain in appearance, and have high solid-to-void ratios with horizontal windows, which at first-floor level are mounted high up beneath deep eaves. Roofs are hipped and are relatively steep, with some mansard style roofs descending to ground-floor height.Despite sharing many common attributes, variation in building style and form allows the identification of approximately 10 different building types. Variation between different buildings types includes the incorporation of features such as bay windows, small adjoining utility rooms to the side, mansard roofs, stepped front faÌÎå_ades and gabled projections to the front or rear. The position and style of the front entrance varies considerably between building types, with generally bold entrances with porches located at the front or to the side of properties.Decoration on properties is limited, and where apparent consists of small scale and simple features on some building types, such as concrete corbels beneath the eaves, small brick parapets, and partial rendering of faÌÎå_ades.Houses are mostly in good condition, and retain much of their original form, although the majority of doors and windows have been replaced in uPVC. Commercial buildings in the Character Area are restricted to a short row of shops beneath apartments on Roman Pavement. However, only one of the three premises was occupied at the time of survey. A number of properties in the south of the area are boarded up due to localised subsidence.Open space in the Character Area includes a number of small, grassed greens in the centre of small crescents and a small playground to the north of Tower Avenue.Good views of the south escarpment are found in places along the southern boundary of the Character Area, although the majority of views are restricted as housing looks inward into each development unit, and streets are mainly arranged obliquely to the slope of the escarpment.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 8,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,34,

On St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s promotion to Cathedral rank in 1072 the Minster's parochial responsibilities continued to be housed within the new church. When the nave was rebuilt in the first half of the 13th century the parish altar was housed in the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌámorning chapel‰Û¡ÌÝå» at its north-west corner (i.e. within RAZ 9.52). The parish was moved to a new building on the site indicated here during the episcopate of Oliver de Sutton (1280-1299) (ed. Srawley 1966, 5, 14-5). This means that the present church site is likely to have preserved below it some remains of the 9th- to 13th-century graveyard population of St Mary of Lincoln (RAZ 9.63) and care should be taken in excavation to distinguish between this graveyard population and burials from the period following the foundation of the parish church. The new building may have always been conceived as the north side of the square between two gatehouses, but the Exchequergate gatehouses were not built until the mid 14th century. Consequently the church occupies a situation analogous to the capellae ante portas found in many enclosed monasteries of various orders. Although such chapels are a normal part of the layout of many Cistercian houses, they are also a feature of many of the great Benedictine houses, as at Peterborough, within Lincoln Diocese. The re-establishment of the parish on a new site offers an excellent opportunity to understand the liturgical layout of a parish church at the turn of the 14th century. Unfortunately, it is not clear that any fabric at all survives from the phase of the church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s initial establishment. The church was extensively repaired in 1638 (Sympson 1906, 330) and then rebuilt in 1695. Although there is some fabric of this date, much dates from the reconstruction of 1882. As any surviving medieval fabric will be of such interest, all repair and reconstruction works here must be accompanied by detailed archaeological recording, aimed first at distinguishing the phases of the surviving fabric and secondly, reconstructing the original late 13th-century liturgical layout.",Summary,"Although the high medieval burial population is not likely to be large, given that the parish consisted mostly of houses in the western part of the close, those buried within the church itself are likely to be elite individuals. To the east of the church is a small open space (in front of modern Exchequergate Lodge), which may have provided some space for burial. The parochial graveyard, however, was south of the cathedral nave and will provide a relatively complete sample of the population of the close throughout the late medieval and Early Modern Eras (included as a detached part of this RAZ).",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.32,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.32,

In 1742, however, the Council thought that the urgent need for bricks for the growing building industry could be supplied from diggings on South Common (Hill 1966, 139n), and although it is not clear where these proposed diggings were, this might be the origin of the two brick pits to the west of the modern Cross O‰Û¡ÌÝå»Cliff Hill (RAZ 11.42). If these areas had been on the common land in 1742, as we might think likely, they could have been placed where they now lie, outside the new boundaries of the new Common, at enclosure. Although there is no evidence from mapping that there was any digging on the Common in this Era. there was at least one attempt to exploit its mineral resources in the 19th century, made by Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s premier industrialist, Joseph Ruston c.1873 (Hill 1974, 201 and n). Ruston‰Û¡ÌÝå»s aim was to extract ironstone, presumably using pillar-and-stall mining techniques, to compete with the workings begun in 1872 on the northern cliff by the Mid-Lincolnshire Ironstone Company (RAZ 11.41.2). As the most energetic of the Lincoln iron-masters, Ruston was keen to establish a smelting works in the city and so add the production of the raw material to his manufacturing enterprises. According to Hill (Ibid.) suitable stone for smelting was found at Bracebridge, but outside the modern District boundary.Any remains of these experimental mines which can be identified at South Common will be of considerable interest, as they will provide insights into the skill and ability of commercial geologists to identify suitable deposits from surface indications as well as providing evidence for the techniques employed.",Summary,"The RAZ boundary includes the whole of the South Common area within the District boundary, including the two brick pits to the west of Cross O‰Û¡ÌÝå» Cliff Hill, which may have been located on the common land before enclosure.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.41.3,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.41.3,

e80ad7ea-6866-4d3c-95c3-f719e7bbcddf,LARA RAZ AREA,,Cemeteries,"The Roman colonia was, typically, ringed with cemeteries. They appear to have been most extensive along the five main roads leading east, north-east and north from the upper city. The cemeteries alongside Greetwell Road, Wragby Road, Nettleham Road and Newport might have joined up to form a single area, beyond the extramural settlements, through which the roads passed. There were further burial grounds east of the lower city, occupying both the flatter land behind the quayside installations, and the hill-slope above. To the west of the city, cemeteries were laid out both on the brow of the hill west of the upper city wall and occupying the sloping ground along the line of the modern West Parade. In all these cases, but especially to the south of the Witham, the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» space of the cemetery was ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivatised‰Û¡ÌÝå» by the encroachment of strip buildings in the later Roman period. In these cases the care and ceremony with which this transition was managed will reveal a great deal about the Roman attitudes to their own past in Lindum and to their own dead. Similar transformations from ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» to ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivate‰Û¡ÌÝå» space might have taken place in the suburbs outside the east and west gates of the upper city. As the record of the people of Lindum, the cemetery archaeology represents one of the most important sectors of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s archaeological resource. Whenever work is undertaken within RAZ 7.24 paleo-osteology will be necessary, with the aim of eventually building up a detailed picture of the physical characteristics of the population. In particular we should aim at understanding whether or not the large populations of the colonia burial grounds represent a large internal population within the colonia itself, or was it more the case that the population of the surrounding countryside was brought to the urban cemeteries for burial. We believe we can demonstrate that the town was a focus for regional administrative and economic activity, and we have already stressed the close connections between ‰Û¡ÌÝÌápublic‰Û¡ÌÝå» and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáritual‰Û¡ÌÝå» gestures in the Roman city. This might lead us to expect that the cemeteries of the Roman city were regarded with favour, not just as a necessary amenity by the resident population, but as a desirable funeral location by the population of the surrounding countryside. Here, we might think, the dead were thought to receive the physical protection of the gods of the city, both traditional (in the shape of the Celtic water spirits) and imperial.It may also be possible, eventually, to assess not just the local domicile of the burial population, but its racial background, through the study of minute skeletal differences, but this will mean detailed work being undertaken on every find over a long period of time. The infant discipline of Archaeogenetics is rapidly developing towards a state where it can be used to assess, not just family kinship, but also the geographical ranges of populations. Although the judgements involved are more complex than might at first appear (Millett 1999, 196-7), such studies should eventually contribute to an understanding the likely percentage of Roman citizens in the population, and consequently some understanding of how closely a colonia‰Û¡ÌÝå»s population was tied to army service. Given that it is thought that Lindum was the seat of one of the early British bishoprics, it would be a matter of very great interest to identify specific Christian burials. Was the Christian community of Lindum buried in separate enclaves within the larger cemeteries or did it open up its own exclusive burial grounds. So far no Roman Christian burial has been identified, although there might be some room for debate about the affiliations of some of the earliest burials at SP72. The search for the distinctiveness of Christian burials should not blind us to the interest of the distinctiveness of burials made under the influence of different belief systems. We have evidence for the cult of Mercury in the south part of",Summary,The boundaries of the RAZ follows those identified by Mr Jones in chapter 7a.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,7.24,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,7.24,

e98fd5fb-3701-4f58-86e0-ddc47beb6b08,LARA RAZ AREA,,South Common,"South Common was largely common grazing in the early modern period, but the earthwork evidence shows that the cliff face here was intensively exploited for clay and stone (RAZ 10.41.1) and the citizens' animals would have been confined to areas between workings. The area north of the road to Canwick and west of the path leading to the south end of the Stamp End causeway became the 'Bargate Closes' during this Era. They are called the New Closes in 1518, although how long before that date they were enclosed remains an important gap in our knowledge, and the demise of a plot of common soil called the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásouth part of the new meadow‰Û¡ÌÝå» to Thomas Archer in 1409 might have occurred early in the enclosure process (Hill 1948, 349n). It would be very helpful to our topographical understanding of the development of the port and river valley floor if we could date the conversion of what must have been common seasonal water-meadow into individual, privately rented closes of meadow. The process of privatisation of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s commons can be effectively studied in this area. In particular, developments here can be compared with those further to the east of the Stamp End causeway, north of the road to Washingborough and south of the marshes. Here a zone of rich meadow land, which never seems to have been ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáprivatised‰Û¡ÌÝå», was still marked as common land on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map. To the east again, in Canwick parish, the western part of this meadow land remained un-enclosed and was known as the Cowpaddle in the 16th century (Cameron 1995, 22). Further east it was known latterly as Canwick Ings or Oxpasture (Mills and Mills 1998).",Summary,The RAZ is defined by the city boundary along its south sides. The western boundary is drawn along Newark Road (which was probably also the western edge of the common land in the late Middle Ages).

e9eed07e-094e-41a7-ac81-e9a50f77bf00,LARA RAZ AREA,,Boundary of Lower Wigford (The Sincil Dyke),"As with Great Gowt, Sincil Dyke offers an important resource for paleo-environmental archaeology and it is possible that important deposits would be encountered during repair and maintenance work on the dyke; it is important that such work is done under archaeological supervision. As at Great and Little Gowt, it is likely that there will be structural timbers surviving from earlier water control features at the south-western corner of the dyke. These should be recorded in situ and then sampled for dendrochronological dating.Apart from the replacement of its doors in 1562 (Sympson 1906, 386), we have no evidence that Great Bargate was altered between its original construction in the late 13th or early 14th century and its demolition in 1756 (HMC 1895, 118). Future research work should aim to explore adaptations to keep it in use during this long period. This should be particularly interesting as we know that the gate was the symbolic boundary of the city at which important visitors were met (for example William III in 1695 - HMC 1895, 113) and this ceremonial function might be detectable in adaptations to the fabric. More easily identifiable, perhaps, will be structural alterations made to adapt the tower for defence in 1644, when it was reportedly fortified (Sympson 1906, 128). Little Bargate, on the other hand, was a much more complex structure and part of this complexity may have been due to its reconstruction in 1565 following partial collapse (HMC 1895, 60). Alterations made in the reconstruction will of great interest to students of Tudor military engineering and may reveal how work of this date adapted the ancient structure for defence against canon fire. Like Great Bargate this gate is thought to have been fortified in 1644 (Sympson 1906, 128) and details of this fortification will be of great interest to students of military engineering.Documentary and topographical sources make it quite clear that there was a wall, and perhaps a rampart as well, inside the Sincil Dyke, at least between the Bargates, although this was not discovered in excavations at Knight‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Place (KP92) which were conducted with this enquiry in mind. A wall north of East Bargate and west of the Dyke is referred to as the Town Wall in a lease as late as 1722 (ed. Birch 1906, 32 No.178). This wall remains to be discovered and dated.The sites of both gates are known precisely and both should be investigated and recorded in detail. It may be that standing fabric of Little Bargate still survives in the building on the site and careful building recording is necessary during development work here. The structure of Great Bargate will survive below the modern road and should be investigated in association with any road works in this area. Both gatehouses were fronted by bridges, both of stone and both apparently contemporary with the gatehouses adjacent. The abutments of these bridges are likely to survive and should be investigated during works to the banks of the dyke and work associated with the modern bridge at Great Bargate.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include a 20m strip either side of the dyke, to include wet deposits which are important for understanding the dyke‰Û¡ÌÝå»s early construction and fill and for palaeo-botanical samples.

Evidence for the physical disappearance of this church has not been forthcoming. It had clearly become redundant before the Reformation, yet it is not mentioned in the City Council documentation surrounding the suppression of redundant parishes (Stocker 1990). This may suggest (as Hill thought - 1948, 287) that it had already been amalgamated with St Swithin before that date and that, therefore, the church materials were not available for disposal by the city. Archaeology might be able to cast some light on this matter and establish the circumstances and date in which the church was amalgamated with St Swithin. It may have been the connection with St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s fair (RAZ 10.18) which drew the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s beast market to this part of town; the Swine Market, came to be held at the bottom of the hill in later centuries.

Land was purchased in Newport, not just for the College but also for a school for 200 pupils alongside, and a master was appointed in 1841; by 1846 there were new buildings in the Gothic style (Hill 1974, 144; Zebedee 1962). Similar sequences of events were occurring in other English dioceses, but it is said that buildings from 1841 still stand, and they represent a vary rare survival. Every care should be taken to record architectural details in the fabric and below-ground information during repair works. The college was originally established to cater for the training of schoolmasters, but in 1862 it was re-launched as a college for women (Wright 1982, 239). As such, it represents an unusual form of institution, slightly earlier in date than the earliest female Oxbridge colleges (cf. Girton College Cambridge of 1869-73). The original layout may reflect its gender role, and comparisons with male institutions elsewhere may be eloquent of the extreme gender differences in education at this period. In 1862 the college was greatly extended with new larger buildings and once again these buildings are of importance for understanding the development of educational theory through the 19th century (Pevsner & Harris 1989, 509). In 1872 a chapel designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield was added. It is notable that the construction of this component did not take the first priority in the construction programme. The buildings were also set within extensive landscaped grounds, which are themselves of interest. The planting here should be recorded as an aid to future conservation and the intention that the college should be set within a parkland setting might be reflected in planning policy.",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the boundaries of the park in which the college sits - as depicted on the 1887 O.S. map.

For some time it was thought to be St Clement, but following new research by Mr Johnson (1992) and partial excavations (SES97, SESA97), it is now thought highly likely that it was St Rumbold. This church stands in the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásenior‰Û¡ÌÝå» location in the Butwerk suburb, just outside Clasketgate gate and this location must indicate an origin either before the existence of Butwerk, or more likely during its first phase of expansion in the early 10th century. This implies that comparison of plan form etc. with somewhat later churches like St Peter ad fontem (RAZ 9.60.12) to the east and St Bavon (9.60.10) to the south may be instructive. The dedication to St Rumbold might also suggest a 10th-century date. Although Hill presumed that the St Rumbold in question was the patron saint of Malines in Flanders (1948, 36), it is possible that this is, rather, the Mercian saint who was culted in King‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Sutton (Northants), Brackley and Buckingham (Thacker 1985, 6-7). This obscure saint may, even so, have had a connection with the group of estates that eventually became the prebend of Sutton-cum-Buckingham at the Cathedral during the pre-Conquest period (Ibid.). This suggestion would imply that St Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s was founded at a similar date to the two other churches in the lower city dedicated to southern Mercian and Wessex saints (Edward and Swithin), that is in the period following the re-conquest of the city by the Kings of Wessex in 942.It is not impossible that the church was founded on land which had been part of the pottery production area (RAZ 9.40.1) immediately prior to its foundation. Excavations on this site should, consequently, also investigate the character of the site on which the church was founded.",Summary,"The site of the church is known, and the southern and north-western boundaries of the churchyard are fixed by the lines of Baggerholmegate (Monks Road) and the short-cut from Clasketgate to Pottergate (the name of which is uncertain, but which was superseded by New Road).

As a vital artery, the City Council sometimes shouldered responsibility for repairs, but frequently they expected other parties to share the costs with them. The structural history of the bridge was clearly complex and important evidence for the medieval bridge and its associated causeways is likely to survive to east and west of the modern bridge abutments. Of particular interest will be the date at which the bridge here was reconstructed, as it is likely to pinpoint the moment at which Lincoln re-emerged as an urban centre.

The area is residential with some small shops, two churches and a community centre. The housing is generally on a domestic scale consisting of many two-storey semi-detached houses and rows of houses. However, there are also three-storey apartment blocks along the northern edge of the estate and one tower block, Trent View. The buildings are mainly of red/brown or yellow brick with little or no decorative detailing and brown concrete tile roofs. There are distinctive patterns of projecting brick on some apartment blocks and many buildings have curved concrete hoods over the doors in a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌámodern‰Û¡ÌÝå» style. Some hoods with thin metal supports are also found in other local authority housing in Lincoln.Ermine West Estate has large grassed areas throughout including some ‰Û¡ÌÝÌávillage greens‰Û¡ÌÝå» with mature trees and housing around the edges, as well as many wide verges along the streets, probably originally intended to improve visibility for drivers. There is a mix of large and small blocks of housing. This fact, combined with some long curved streets, the large numbers of cul-de-sacs and a lack of landmark buildings, makes it difficult to move around the Character Area. Most residential streets are overlooked by doors and windows.Access to the large open spaces adjacent to the area is very limited and road access to the area as a whole is limited to one road from the west and two roads from the east. There is no vehicle or pedestrian access to the north and only limited pedestrian access to the south. However, there are good road links from the main roads surrounding the Character Area to the rest of the city and beyond, via Riseholme Road and Burton Road.

It is therefore possible, if not likely, that the bank and ditch system remained a visible feature in the landscape in the Colonia Era.

In the Colonia Era, this boundary could have survived simply because no one was willing to expend the effort in demolishing it, but given the symbolic charge which it had carried in previous periods, we should explore the possibility that it was retained in the Colonia Era as a traditional boundary of the city.

Mr Herridge notes that there is a difference in the sizes of the bricks used for the two structures suggesting that one may be earlier than the other. These bridges were bypassed in 1937 by a new road-line and a new pair of wider bridges c.45m to the south (Herridge 1999, No.5077). These bridges are of box-vault construction of reinforced concrete and are of engineering interest in their own right. The earlier bridges should be compared with other bridges built during the West Lincoln Drainage Scheme to seek out any differences occasioned by the fact that, uniquely, these were intended to carry the turnpike.

edfde690-3a57-4f6e-b9b3-ff6519f42ddc,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Lower Wigford (south of Great Gowt),"As in the High Medieval Era, Wigford south of Great Gowt had a quite different character from Upper Wigford. The large funnel-shaped market (RAZ 9.20) had transformed into the market and fair on Lincoln Green, outside the Sincil Dyke, by the 13th century, presumably leaving the wide High Street from Great Gowt to the Bargates without a practical function beyond servicing the houses on either side. Nevertheless something was holding the population in this part of town - in 1428 none of the parishes of Lower Wigford within Sincil Dyke was shown as having fewer than 10 inhabitants. Furthermore houses continued to line the High Street in both Speed‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1611 and Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1722. Both show the area south of Sincil Dyke free from housing, but these street-fronts had been occupied by religious institutions in the High Medieval Era and so this is perhaps unsurprising. Documentary sources tell us very little of the buildings in this part of the suburb in the Early Modern Era, although the tannery established in St Margaret‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Parish, Wigford around 1200 (ed. Major 1968, RA2464, p. 69) may have continued and may have been one of many. Similarly standing buildings of this date are virtually non-existent - the only contender is the transverse range behind the modern pub called The Reindeer, which looks late 17th- or 18th-century in date, but about which nothing seems to be known. This is an important survival and any future work here should be accompanied by appropriate recording. It is plain from this that any information on the housing of this part of Wigford in the early modern period will be of great value. In particular we should be interested in why the suburb continued in existence at all once the city had shrunk back towards the Stonebow - what were the special factors (possibly industrial factors) which sustained this far-flung community? In answering this question we may be able to compare housing in Lower Wigford with that in Upper Wigford, north of the Gowt. Were the two suburbs still as different in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries as they seem to have been in the 10th, 11th and 12th?",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the River Witham, Sincil Dyke and the Great Gowt Drain.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.34,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.34,

ee19e30c-9989-4719-a2f5-af5e208bdc0f,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in Butwerk suburb,"Compared with most of the city's suburbs north of the river, Butwerk seems to have had a more favourable location for continued prosperity but, even so, by 1428 five of the six parishes were reported as having fewer than 10 inhabitants. The exception was St Augustine, the parish which included the waterfront, which seems to have made a living providing warehousing to service the wool trade in the 14th century, when the cloth industry collapsed. Although at a less intensive scale, then, the suburb continued to combine domestic and commercial activity and this combination should be looked for in future archaeological work on the housing stock here. Even so, we must be aware that most of Butwerk, like the city as a whole, was also in serious decline throughout the Early Modern Era. The timing and detail of the decline and retrenchment is of great interest. The fortunes of Butwerk were closely related to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s commercial prosperity, and consequently we might expect the whole suburb simply to return to pasture in the Early Modern Era. In the western part of the suburb, however, the house on Friar‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane (BE73) was greatly extended at this date, whilst to the north, on the corner of modern Broadgate and Monks Road, a major house with a ground floor hall and cross-wing was extensively rebuilt in the 14th century and survived until 1828 (Jones et.al, 1990, 141-2). No doubt some buoyancy was lent to the Butwerk economy by the grant of the new fair at St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Croft in 1409 (RAZ 10.18), and, towards the end of the Early Modern Era, the beast market was certainly an important factor. It would be very helpful to find some evidence for the accommodation in the eastern part of the suburb, which relates to such deliberate attempts to stimulate the suburb. If carefully investigated, it may be possible to show whether such buildings were established by institutional or private initiative.The St. Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå»s fairs site notwithstanding, considerable areas of the eastern parts of the suburb must have been depopulated by the 16th century, and Speed‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1611 shows only Broadgate and the waterfront with built-up street fronts. By the time of Stukeley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map (1722) the situation is even more extreme - the only street fronts outside the eastern walls are shown in the triangle between Monks Road, Holgate and Pottergate. The areas abandoned will have been used for something and the manner in which they were reused for agricultural activity may tell us something about the forces which lead to the depopulation. It seems that most of the land in this area remained as closes, presumably for fattening stock. The question we need to approach from the archaeological data is whether or not the enclosures were used by the citizens as a whole or whether they became the private property of individuals.",Summary,The RAZ follows the same boundaries as RAZ 9.29,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.29,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.29,

ee233c70-be92-4ab4-8d7e-0e5e2f704597,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Broadway Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌBroadway Character Area is an entirely residential suburb located in the north of the city between two radial roads, Newport and Nettleham Road. The majority of the Character Area consists of a single coherent residential development along Broadway and Bruce Road, but several cul-de-sacs, mainly in the south of the area, are composed of several build units of a few or single individually styled houses. The centre of the area consists of the large cemetery of St. Nicholas‰Û¡ÌÝå» Church. Elements of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s former open agricultural character, such as field boundaries associated with the enclosure of land during the Early Industrial period, have survived in the current townscape, notably in the orientation of streets and houses. Construction of residential housing began in the Early Industrial period and continued throughout the Post-Railway expansion period. During the Late Victorian/Edwardian period and early on in the Inter-war period, residential development began to occur along small cul-de-sacs off Newport and Nettleham Road. The majority of housing in the area was planned towards the end of the Inter-war period, though not actually built until soon after the end of the Second World War. During the Modern period apartment blocks along Williamson Street replaced the rows of Late Victorian/Edwardian terraced houses.Houses within the largest and most coherent development in the area are coherent in form, style, and in the way they are laid out along streets. They are mostly set back 6-10 metres from the footway, with spacious gardens and driveways to the front. Largely consistent building height, deep setbacks and often broad and straight streets lead to an open and suburban sense of enclosure throughout much of the area. The plainness of houses and the consistency of their form and materials is illustrative of the constraints on acquiring materials during the Post-war period. Similarly, the use of a coarse-grained concrete in driveways, crossovers, and in the public realm is a unifying characteristic of the area, and illustrates a pragmatic and improvised approach to construction, as well as the austerity of the Post-war period as a whole.In addition there are several smaller groups of houses arranged around cul-de-sacs which are generally built individually or as part of a small build unit. However, the architectural style of the majority of properties is similar to that normally associated with the 1970s such as a horizontal emphasis, shallow pitched roofs, wide facades, and extended horizontal windows.

Whether it was thought of as anything other than a property boundary at this period is open to investigation. It had certainly found a role as a stone quarry by the end of the 18th century (and quarries are indicated in the north-western parts of the ditch by the time of Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1819 - RAZ 11.41.4. As the suburb itself seems to have dwindled away to a handful of farmsteads by the 18th century (RAZ 10.26), it is perhaps unlikely that this boundary served any military function in the Early Modern Era, although its continued usefulness as a boundary is self-evident. As in the previous Era, the point at which the ditch is crossed by Ermine Street will be the most informative regarding its continued use or otherwise as a meaningful barrier. It is not impossible that the presumed bridge over the ditch might have been protected by earthwork defences during the Civil War. Future work here could be aimed at answering the question whether there was any military purpose to the defences in the Early Modern Era. Particularly interesting would be any evidence for temporary defences at times of civil emergencies (such as the Civil War). Such evidence is particularly likely, perhaps, at the bridge across the northern ditch.",Summary,"The RAZ is drawn to include the estimated width of the ditch, berm and proposed internal wall.

The second area of settlement activity is understood in greater detail as part of it fell within the excavations at HG72. Here a small circular structure (a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáround-house‰Û¡ÌÝå»?) was constructed on a sand island within the area of pools and meres west of the Stamp End causeway in the Late pre-Roman Iron Age (Darling and Jones 1988). These structures are of very great interest, precisely because they are unexpected. The votive deposits associated with the putative causeway at Stamp End suggest that the pool which formed behind the causeway was held ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásacred‰Û¡ÌÝå», and so any structures built on islands within the pool will be of very great interest either because they constitute part of the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáritual landscape‰Û¡ÌÝå», or because they show that the ritual landscape was combined with a working landscape. Further information about either possibility should be actively sought in all development affecting the, partly defined, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásand island‰Û¡ÌÝå».

With the exception of the riverside land (which was taken up with port facilities - RAZ 9.2), the whole of the area between the top of the cliff and the water was given over to permanent pasture. However, almost all of it belonged to the monks of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey York and formed their estate of Monks Leas based on their small Priory of St Mary Magdalene (RAZ 9.55.1, RAZ 9.55.2). Fortunately a number of early modern law cases give us a clear picture of how this land was used, at least in the 15th and 16th centuries (Hill 1948, 338-43), and it is clear from several of these documents that the rights established in those cases were traditional ones. Although the monks clearly owned the land eastwards from the eastern boundary ditch of Butwerk as far as the parish boundary with Greetwell, and apparently as far north as the Greetwell Road, the citizens had always maintained their common rights to graze animals over most of the land at certain times of year. The long-running legal disputes are all aspects of the obvious conflict of interests the citizens' common rights would have created. Apart from disputes about access to the Blackdyke and other port facilities, on or adjoining York lands, much dispute was about the various enclosures adjoining Butwerk. These closes (for example Calvecroft, Inland and Beridge Close) seem to have been the direct equivalents of the closes along the western side of Newland and the same range of questions applies to them. Dating the establishment of the eastern closes may be even more helpful, however, because of the greater understanding permitted by the more plentiful survival of documents.",Summary,This RAZ includes the whole of RAZ 9.41.2.

The City may have used its power to wind it up in order to make money out of the fabric and site (see also St Stephen, Holy Trinity, St Andrew Wigford RAZ 10.60.14, 10.60.18, 10.60.19). The church was of sufficient standing to have attracted the guild of St Nicholas, to which a bequest was made in 1381 (Venables 1887-8b, 334) and, prior to the Reformation, as one might expect in this part of Wigford, the church was still attracting patronage of elite merchants, such as Alderman John Fox, who gave money to the construction of a new rood (which should be detectable archaeologically) and for an obit here in 1522 (ed. Foster 1914, 105-7). This documentation suggests that St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s would have been a large and ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáfully developed‰Û¡ÌÝå» late medieval church, with a correspondingly complex and interesting ritual layout - unlike many of the Lincoln examples. Consequently the archaeology of St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s may help in addressing questions about whether the Old Religion was in decline, or whether, in fact, it had widespread popular support (Duffy 1992). Certainly the burials so soon before the Reformation suggest that the church was still viable on its eve and, consequently, we have to look for other reasons why the City Council chose to liquidate it - which they did over a long period between 1552 and 1598 (Stocker 1990, 21). The church buildings and the churchyard were turned over to other uses in the second half of the 16th century, and archaeological identification and documentation of these uses will be of great interest, but both were eventually leased to the stall-holders in the new Cornmarket in 1598 (RAZ 10.22.9) (HMC 1895, 75). The Rectory of St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s seems to have been located immediately south of the churchyard (ed. Major 1968 63-6, RA 2457-9 - RAZ 9.60.23) - perhaps built within the early graveyard. The building itself will be of considerable interest in the Early Modern period and should be compared with other known clergy houses (like those at St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s) as well as with secular examples (RAZ 9.33, 9.34 etc.). The relative wealth of the parish may have ensured the continuation of the clergy property here, and it will be important to know whether or not it was still occupied when the parish was united with St Benedict and St Mary-le-Wigford in 1549.",Summary,The site of the churchyard has been traced through early leases and the RAZ is intended to include the whole of the plot indicated.

These indications of relative wealth and association with the heart of the maritime city may have made the church distinctive in its plan-form and superstructure compared with its neighbours in Butwerk, and may have resulted in late medieval extensions. For example, a member of an important city merchant family, William Strawdon, left 3/4d to repairs to the fabric in 1434 (ed. Foster 1914, 164) and archaeological research here needs to contrast the repair of this church with the terminal decline of its fellows in Butwerk. But although this parish may have been marginally more populous in the 15th century, by the 16th the church was redundant and the City Council issued a number of ordinances aimed at capitalising on its property between 1533 and 1566 (Stocker 1990, 20).",Summary,"The RAZ includes the whole churchyard, all four boundaries of which have been traced by Mr Johnson (1992) at the corner of St Rumbold‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Street and Friars‰Û¡ÌÝå» Lane (formerly Lumnor Lane) and which has been attributed since the 19th century to St Rumbold.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.11,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.11,

effa08af-c92f-4cbb-994b-bfd018b1cba2,LARA RAZ AREA,,Dominican Friary,"The four friaries of the major orders (Augustinian, Carmelite, Dominican and Franciscan) in Lincoln represent a good group nationally, and in addition, Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s exceptionally rare example of the Friary of the Sack (extinct by 1307) continued in religious use in the early part of the Early Modern Era. The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In the course of the final two centuries of their existence we should be interested in adaptations to the churches and other claustral buildings which may cast light on the changing attitudes of the orders to their rules and to their relationship with the secular world. In the post-Dissolution period these sites retain considerable interest. Their archaeology should cast light on the attitudes of the new secular owners to the old religion; was it deliberately denigrated or were its monuments treated with dignity and respect? In the case of the Carmelite Friary and St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Conduit we may have rare evidence for the latter attitude. In all of these cases we must be aware that the fraternal buildings are likely to have converted for secular uses at the Dissolution. Little is known about these conversions in Lincoln or elsewhere and the chance should be taken to study this important aspect of early modern archaeology as well as the archaeology of these Friaries themselves.The large and important Dominican Friary in Butwerk remained one of the most important religious institutions in the town and should be very informative in the consideration of the conversions of medieval institutions into private estates. In the course of the final two centuries of its existence we should be interested in the development and adaptation of the friary, both the church and the conventual buildings. Changes to such structures should be assessed for their contribution to our understanding of the changing attitudes of the friars to their Rule and to their relationships with the lay public. The church, in particular, will preserve, in its design and furnishing, evidence for the development of late medieval piety and dogma, and the identification of such changes should be a priority in subsequent work.The Dominican Friary in Lincoln was converted into a grand house (known as the Blackfriars) sometime in the mid 16th century, which remained standing until at least 1642 (Cameron 1985, 16). The fact that the ruins shown by Speed and Stukeley were located in the south-western corner of the large precinct, near the junction of Holgate with Monks Road, probably suggests that the new house was a direct conversion of the earlier monastic buildings. We need to know how this conversion treated the various fraternal structures; did the church form part of the new house, for example, or was it (as in so many other cases) razed to the ground? Similarly, the question was raised in RAZ 9.53.2 as to whether the friars had exploited the resources of stone and clay along the cliff-edge which their precinct was enlarged to include, and it will of great interest to know whether any such resources were exploited once the site fell into secular hands. Like many houses of Friars the Lincoln Dominicans interested themselves in the water supply (RAZ 9.53.2) and the City Council interested themselves in the future of the water supply at the Dissolution. In this respect, at least the city fathers were trying to pick up the philanthropic aspects of the friars‰Û¡ÌÝå» work and continue with it (Stocker 1990). Archaeological information about the development of the fraternal conduit system in the late Middle Ages will be interesting, as will information casting light on its fate in secular hands after the Dissolution.",Summary,"The RAZ is intended to include the whole of the extended precinct of the friary, and has been drawn using boundaries deduced from many documentary sources.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.53.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.53.2,

f0d6dc10-5fbe-4e22-8042-85b8880e01a8,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Tritton Road Industrial Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌTritton Road Industrial Character Area is a large edge of city centre mixed-use area that extends either side of Tritton Road, one of the main arterial roads into and out of the city. The scale and form of buildings and setting within large areas of parking are typical features of an out-of-town retail centre but its location is actually very close to the city centre, within walking distance of St. Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s retail area in the city centre. Due to the strong linear boundaries of the river and railway to the east and west, access into and out of the area is confined to Tritton Road itself, as well as Dixon Street and Firth Road which bridge the river.Since the Early 19th century the Character Area has undergone, and continues to undergo, several changes which reflect Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s industrial, commercial and residential growth. The area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s former rural and wetland character was initially superseded by 19th century industrial growth, which itself is becoming increasingly replaced with commercial, and more recently residential, developments. Little of the area‰Û¡ÌÝå»s rural character survives, and the majority of 19th century industry has been overwritten by modern commercial and residential development. Nevertheless, the townscape retains many elements of its former rural and industrial uses, which contribute to a complex and evolving townscape.Developments are based along minor roads and cul-de-sacs leading off Tritton Road. Large and irregularly shaped urban blocks are subdivided by a coarse grain of building plots. The public/private boundary in the Character Area is varied. Industrial units tend to have high, impermeable boundaries around the perimeter of the plot. The public/private boundary between retail/commercial units and the road tends to be lower or less solid to enable visibility onto the buildings behind. Within the area there are also many open spaces, including extensive areas of car parking, yards, and grass and planted verges. The River Witham and Main Drain both cross the Character Area. Mature trees along the western boundary screen the industrial area from view from the west. The majority of buildings have a large footprint. Buildings vary from 1-2 tall storeys in height to enable manufacturing and other uses. Overall the buildings have a horizontal emphasis and this combines with the wide roads and large areas of open space to create a low sense of enclosure. Buildings are generally detached units or rows of attached buildings of similar plan form arranged either side by side or around a courtyard. The latter often have a communal plot with no boundaries between units and shared car parking. Plots often have a large amount of open space for parking, storage or distribution. The majority of buildings are of solid brick construction or steel frame with a variety of other materials used for the outer shell. Decoration is very limited, and primarily confined to the colour of the cladding and any signage. Properties generally have very few windows and doors leading to a high solid to void ratio and many inactive frontages. The door is often the main feature on buildings, emphasised by large porches on many retail units. Residential properties have a lower solid to void ratio and UPVc windows. Street furniture is frequent and modern. There are many tall lampposts, especially in areas of retail parking. Along Tritton Road there are many large street signs, sets of traffic lights, bollards and long stretches of metal railings to control pedestrian movement. In some parts of the Character Area there are a number of different road and pavement surfaces, some in a degraded condition which, combined with the variety of materials used for plot boundaries, leads to a feeling of incoherence in the public realm.Tritton Road is the major road, though Dixon Street also has a heavy flow of traffic. Tritton Road is busy at all times of day but especially at commuter times. Vitality within the area is mainly confined to business hours. Along almost the entire length of Tritton Road there are partially obstructed northerly views of the Cathedral and wider skyline of the North Escarpment. From several places on Tritton Road there are also rural views east onto the South Escarpment.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 46,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,68,

f0ef5558-0a99-4eda-93c6-6ebeaa6bd618,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Monk's Abbey Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe boundaries of the Monks Abbey Character Area are formed by Monks Road to the north and Winn Street to the south. To the west the boundary is the most northerly section of Tempest Street and the rear of 1-17 Tempest Street. To the east the boundary is the western boundary of 253 Monks Road and the rear of the properties which face the Abbey ruins as far as 74a Winn Street. The area includes Tempest Street, the north side of Winn Street and the south side of Monks Road.Monks Abbey Character Area forms a significant green space within the Monks Road neighbourhood with a variety of recreational uses. The historic ruins of Monks Abbey are a key characteristic of the area and are centrally placed and visible from all around, including from Monks Road and the railway to the south. The recreation ground is attractive and well used. Recreational facilities for both private and public use are provided including a bowling club, children‰Û¡ÌÝå»s play area and ball court. The residential houses which face on to the recreation ground form part of the overall character. On the eastern side there are a group of semi-detached and detached houses of one to two storeys built in the Modern Period. On the western side are Edwardian two storey houses along Tempest Street which have higher levels of decoration than other terraces running south off Monks Road. The terraced houses on Monks Road also face the park and help provide a good sense of enclosure to the north.Some poor quality fencing around the park, the security fencing around the Monks Abbey ruins, and the nearby railway line, electricity power station and pylons detract from the appearance of the ruins and recreation ground. The busy Monks Road to the north creates intrusive traffic noise""",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 73,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,52,

f1017fc6-1a0d-4b8c-b42b-3e07c006e725,LARA RAZ AREA,,The Mechanics' Institute,"The City Grammar School had been established in the upper floor of the Greyfriary since 1568, whilst, until 1718 at least, there were textile works also housed here (RAZ 10.53.4). The building was still known as The Jersey School in the late 18th century, and indeed a textile school may still have existed here when the Mechanics' Institute was formed in 1833. From then until 1858 the Institute occupied the building with a subscription library as well as a museum and a newspaper room (Hill 1974, 147, 227). Details in the fabric of the surviving building will date from this period of use and, when put together, this information will be valuable to students of the early development of working-class education. In 1858, however, the Institute was forced to leave the Greyfriary to make room for expansion of the Grammar School, who had long occupied the upper floor (Hill 1974, 56-58). A comparison between the layout of the building‰Û¡ÌÝå»s lower floor when occupied by the Institute and under the Grammar School would be of particular interest. What differences were thought necessary in a building for teaching the working classes when compared with teaching the students of the Grammar School? The layout of the upper floor, presumably always the Grammar School, is also of great interest and can be reconstructed from details in the surviving fabric. Similarly the development of educational reform should also be legible in the fabric, perhaps especially the impact of the Act of 1870 (Hill 1974, 281-2). The development of the Grammar School in the late 19th century is complex, with its division into separate parts and its re-union on a single site on Upper Lindum Street in 1900 (RAZ 11.57) (Hill 1974, 283), and some reflections of this complexity may also be comprehensible in the Greyfriary fabric. As a result, the Greyfriary building was vacant in 1900 after over 600 years and its availability was certainly part of the impetus for the foundation of the City Museum in 1906. There is a rapidly developing interest in the history of the growth of museums and any surviving information in the Greyfriars‰Û¡ÌÝå» fabric, which might cast light on how the collection was originally displayed, will be of interest in these on-going studies (eg, Vergo 1989).",Summary,The RAZ is mapped following the site‰Û¡ÌÝå»s depiction on the 1887 O.S. map and includes a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.55,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.55,

A useful summary of current research questions in legionary fortresses is contained in Jones 1975. Work within this RAZ should seek to distinguish the distinctively different plan forms of infantry and cavalry barrack blocks aiming, eventually, at understanding whether the occupation force at Lincoln was a whole legion or merely a detachment from it. In addition to architectural details, the change in the garrison from Legio IX to Legio II will have been reflected in many aspects of the material culture, and all deposits of this period need to be investigated with this in mind. It may eventually prove possible, for example, to distinguish between the pottery or artefacts used or valued by one legion when compared with others, and this may permit a picture of changes in composition and of command of such forces.",Summary,"The boundary of the RAZ is taken as the outer lip of the fortress ditch. This has only been exposed on the western side but is assumed to have run at a similar distance from the rampart on the north, south and east sides.

f2b2aba6-6c56-47b8-ba7b-05920cbf20ed,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Swallow Beck Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌSwallow Beck Character Area is a large suburban residential area located in the south west of the City of Lincoln. It is dominated by a series of residential developments built during the late Post-War [1946-1966 AD] and Modern Period [1967-2009 AD] that form part of larger suburban areas either side of Newark Road. Although residential development has overwritten much of the former rural landscape, some traces of earlier activity remain evident in the modern townscape such as the High Medieval alignment of Doddington Road. The majority of the Character Area is divided into small to medium sized urban blocks, which are irregular in shape. However, urban blocks towards the edges of the area frequently extend along impermeable boundaries such as the rear plots of properties along Newark Road and the railway line which forms the western boundary of the area. Streets consist of a loose grid pattern of circular roads, with cul-de-sacs leading off them. Houses in the area turn their backs on surrounding areas, but remain connected by a limited number of roads to the north and south. There is a medium-to-high building density throughout much of the area. Properties are located towards the centre/front of their plots with gardens and driveways to the front, and often occupy almost the full width of the plot. Buildings mostly consist of detached 2-storey houses and, to a lesser extent, bungalows. In addition there are a smaller number of semi-detached properties and short rows located in the centre and southwest of the area respectively. The majority of houses are two or three bays in width, with the exception of some wider four-bay width bungalows.The form and style of residential properties varies considerably throughout the Character Area. However within individual development units, the townscape is generally coherent, with many ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáthemed‰Û¡ÌÝå» and common characteristics, such as building density, form, style and scale, road layout and building materials. The style and amount of decoration on properties varies between development units and between individual houses within them. In the main, houses are plain in style with simple decoration. Tritton Road is a very wide two-lane width carriageway running north/south through the area that forms a strong and largely impermeable barrier through the Character Area, inhibiting pedestrian and vehicular movement. Public spaces are limited to the playground and Pike Drain in the northeast of the Character Area, and open grassed area surrounding De Wint Court, a residential care home. Private space is extensive with substantial plots incorporating medium-to-large private gardens to the front and rear of properties.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 105,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,102,

We presume that a barrier across the river valley was re-established here early in the High Medieval Era (RAZ 9.1), and this might imply that any water control system which may have been installed by the Romans in the 4th century (RAZ 7.13) quickly fell into disuse. Any evidence that a the barrier was maintained, or that it was deliberately broken down in the Early Medieval Era will be of very great interest. It may be significant that, although there are finds of votive metalwork from both the Roman Era and the High Medieval Era from the vicinity of Stamp End, there are no finds of the Early Medieval Era (Stocker and Everson 2003).

We believe that the market place here is much older than the formal grant of its market charter in 1330, an act which may itself have been a response to the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s economic problems. Dr Bischoff believes that this ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáre-founded‰Û¡ÌÝå» market only ever attracted local produce, from a limited area of Lindsey, and this may be detectable archaeologically through judicious use of certain types of finds evidence (Bischoff 1975, 163). It is presumed that the well (Grantham‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Well - see RAZ 9.16) was already in existence by the Early Modern Era, but we should note that its name may refer to the Grantham family (Cameron 1985, 182) which rose to importance in the city only in the 15th century, and it is possible that the well was a gift of theirs, perhaps made in the context of yet another attempt to stimulate the market. Although the 14th -century re-foundation was probably intended as a measure to revive economic activity in this part of the city, it seems to have had little long-term effect and, by the end of the 16th century, the suburb comprised little more than a few small-holdings, associated with the open fields all round, whilst parts of the market place itself (those parts which were in St Nicholas‰Û¡ÌÝå» parish as opposed to St John‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s map of 1842) had been encroached on by small farms and cottages.

Despite the church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s status as belonging to the prebend of All Saints Hungate, it may not have been very large or wealthy, although it may have been the All Saints church which is reported as having been the home of the Guild of St Edmund of Pontigny in 1276 and 1363 (Westlake 1919, 166-75; Hill 1948, 207-8). The parish must have been badly affected by the collapse of the cloth industry and it is one of those with fewer than 10 inhabitants in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287). Although Hill thought the parish was amalgamated with St Martin (1948, 144), Dr Vince has shown convincingly (chapter 9a) that it was in fact amalgamated with St Peter-at-Arches. As it disappeared sometime in the 15th century, the sealed graveyard population is likely to be of considerable interest and similar questions should be addressed as at St Andrew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and St George‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. Similarly the church itself will represent a good example of a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáback-street‰Û¡ÌÝå» church arrested in the course of its structural and liturgical development in the mid 15th century and will provide an interesting comparison with churches of similar type which struggled on to the Reformation.

f3e3c715-4631-4cde-b5d1-69b182bb970b,LARA RAZ AREA,,Roads beyond the Canabae,"Newport, Wragby Road and Newark Road all lie on the lines of known Roman roads, most of which were probably laid out in the Military period. Complete sections across such roads, from the base of deposits up to modern road surfaces, are particularly valuable in assessing the dates at which the various routes represented came into (and went out of) use. The aqueduct which ran along the north-west side of Nettleham Road, and which is known to have existed in later Roman times (RAZ 7.17), is included within this RAZ. It is not known whether it had its origins in the Military period, but investigations should regard this question as a priority.",Summary,"The RAZ boundaries along Newport (A15), Nettleham Road, Wragby Road and the south-west part of Newark Road are all drawn to include a 50m wide strip along the known or expected lines of the Roman roads.

It is one of those churches which disappeared during the 15th century; the parish was reported to have had fewer than 10 inhabitants in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287) and that is the latest reference we have to it. Hill thought that this church might be the All Hallows which the City Council ordered to be taken down in 1533 (1956, 21), but a more likely candidate here is All Saints in Hungate (RAZ 10.60.43). Consequently we are left with the impression that the church was wound up before the Reformation, and Venables says that it was united with St Michael-on-the-Mount before 1354 (1887-8, 341). All of this suggests that the archaeology of the site will represent a good example of a minor ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáback-street‰Û¡ÌÝå» church arrested in its late medieval layout, permitting study of the liturgical arrangements here to compare with grander churches elsewhere in the city. Archaeology may also reveal when the church did finally pass out of ecclesiastical use, and to what uses it was subsequently put. As in all of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s other cases of redundancy, the way in which the site was treated following liquidation is of considerable interest, especially if there are any signs that burials were treated with any special care or that profane uses for certain parts of the former church were avoided.",Summary,"The site of the churchyard can be partly reconstructed. The south boundary is known to have been formed by the terrace wall behind St Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Terrace (a section of churchyard deposits was seen when this wall collapsed in 1983). The west and north boundaries will have followed the line of the lane which formerly ran diagonally across the hillside from the north end of Beaumont Fee towards the south gate of the upper city. It is not known, however, whether this boundary ran alongside the lane or whether there was a row of houses between it and the churchyard. The east boundary will have followed the line of Michaelgate (formerly Parchmentgate), but again it is not clear whether the churchyard was separated from the road by a row of houses.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,10.60.34,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,10.60.34,

Although it can be argued that most of these small closes are likely to date from the Early Modern Era, (RAZ 10.8.1), enclosure of some may have begun in the late 13th century, in the wake of the collapse of the cloth industry.

f4b18148-f4d0-44ca-89e9-6a78a590bfee,LARA RAZ AREA,,Houses in the lower city,"The street pattern of the lower city of Lincoln is readily susceptible to a plan form analysis, and Dr Vince‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work, based on just such an analysis, has shown that the street pattern can be divided into two basic units. The northern unit, on the steeper parts of the hill slope, has already been discussed and a group of anomalous property blocks which fan out down the hill from the south gate have been identified, bounded by an extinct lane north of the former church of St John-the-Poor on the west and Danesgate on the east (RAZ 9.22). The discussion of this RAZ makes the proposal that housing within this triangle, down-slope as far as Motherby Lane on the west and Danes Terrace on the east, may have had its origin in booths laid out in a large market place. To the east of Danesgate and south of the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace, a rectangular block lying on a steep slope seems to have been the parish of St Andrew-under-Palace in the High Medieval period. Properties extending back from Danesgate towards the city wall, might represent properties which originally faced on to the fan-shaped market place, but they could just as easily represent late-infilling subsequent to the market‰Û¡ÌÝå»s subdivision. The same possibilities arise with the narrow block of properties between Beaumont Fee and the western city wall, and indeed along the north side of the lost lane north of St John-the-Poor.South of the line formed by Motherby Lane and Danes Terrace, Dr Vince has pointed out that the lower city is planned around a fairly regular grid of streets, with north-to-south roads on the lines of Free School Lane/Danesgate, Bank Street/Flaxengate, Ermine Street, Hungate/Mint Lane and Beaumont Fee. The east-to-west roads in this grid seem to be represented today by Motherby Lane/ St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane/Grantham Street and Park Street/Clasketgate. Dr Vince argues convincingly that this grid represents a formalisation of the plan of the Anglo-Scandinavian settlement undertaken some centuries after the settlement‰Û¡ÌÝå»s original foundation (chapter 9a). Besides Ermine Street itself, only Silver Street can be clearly seen to be earlier than the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágrid‰Û¡ÌÝå» and therefore part of the earlier phase of initial Anglo-Scandinavian occupation. This observation makes the investigation of properties along Silver Street an important priority, with the aim of establishing its date relative to the super-imposed grid. This would be revealed particularly at the points at which Silver Street is crossed by the lines of Bank Street/Flaxengate and Free School Lane/Danesgate. We know more about Anglo-Scandinavian housing in the lower city than anywhere else in Lincoln. The extensive excavations in Flaxengate provided important sequences of groups of near-complete structures (Perring 1983), which still provide the yardstick against which similar finds elsewhere should be considered. Dr Vince has shown that, using the assemblages from pits in the back yards at Flaxengate, for example, we are able to identify the character and likely domestic setting of domestic pits found in much less extensive excavations (chapter 9a). Although all of wood, the Flaxengate buildings provided a range of construction techniques which we can search for across future sites. Dr Vince has also shown that it would be a mistake to allocate particular styles of construction to houses belonging to people of specific ethnicities. Virtually all of the people of 10th-century Lincoln were incomers and any ethnic identity they proclaimed is more likely to be manifested in other socio-political constructs (eg. political or religious affiliation), rather than in techniques of woodworking. House types and artefact assemblages need to be compared within the various different plan form components to see if they reflect any of the radical changes in town-planning we have proposed. Buildings of the Flaxengate area also provide a paradigm for the chronological development of housing types, through various types of wooden c",Summary,The housing RAZ for the lower city is defined by the city walls on all four sides.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.25,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.25,

They used a bequest from James Usher, a wealthy city goldsmith, and at the centre of the new public park they created the Usher Gallery to house his remarkable collection of works of art. The new gallery was the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s third major public building designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield and opened in 1927 (the other two being the Water Tower and the Library (RAZs 11.46 & 11.72). The former pleasure park was not re-created, however, and the space around the new gallery was left unplanted, except with tidy municipal flower-beds, the earthworks of the earlier garden left as grassy mounds. The building itself is of great interest as a purpose-built provincial art gallery, in remarkably original condition inside and out. The plan is designed to give maximum effect to the objects on display and the, inevitably, blank exterior is consequently highly decorated. Records should be made during repair and restoration work with the aim of understanding how the original layout of the collections utilised this unusual building. The study of Museology has advanced considerably in recent years and the original intentions behind the Usher design will be of great interest (ed. Vergo 1989)",Summary,"The RAZ includes the whole of the public garden created in 1927, mapped following the boundaries depicted on various O.S. map editions and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.73,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.73,

f53b67b8-b330-48b5-8fca-341030ff0737,LARA RAZ AREA,,Houses in Newport,"In the consideration of the open fields (RAZ 9.9.1) it was suggested that the suburb might have been laid out over part of the north field. Although it might be quite difficult technically, it is a point of such importance that efforts must be made to see if the soils below the earliest occupation levels here were the result of cultivation. Equally the fills of any boundary ditches lying below occupation levels here will be of great interest and value. Something is known from charter evidence about the houses in Newport suburbs, mostly contained in the Registrum Antiquissimum. It will be particularly valuable if future excavations could be made to coincide with those properties for which charter evidence also exists. Furthermore, as the 18th- and 19th-century development in this area occurred on different street front lines from those of the High Medieval Era (RAZ 9.16), the properties of this suburb are likely to be better preserved than in many other areas of the city and they constitute, therefore, a particularly important resource. In addition to questions of the date of their establishment and their plan forms, we will be particularly interested in any information regarding the extent to which houses in this suburb were the dwellings of citizens who worked in the arable fields of the city, or were they more involved in trading in the market? Or both? The documentary evidence provides plenty of evidence that these properties included what sound like agricultural buildings and they seem to have been connected with the fields (by which they were nearly surrounded) by many lanes and alleys. By contrast, the plan form, with uniform rear boundaries to the plots and the clear evidence that the whole settlement unit was based around a market, suggests that this was a planned urban component.

f687fc26-d27c-4184-b728-c81e0cd520a4,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Western-Huntlea Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌWestern Hunt Lea is a residential suburban Character Area with most of its current townscape dating from the late Inter-War Period (1919-1945) and Post-War Period with large areas of largely separate residential streets and cul-de-sacs. There was early ribbon development on former enclosed fields along Boultham Park Road with most housing in later large developments leading off Boultham Park Road with a geometric street pattern and large numbers of cul-de-sacs. Boultham Park Road and Hall Drive were part of a private drive from High Street to Boultham Hall in the 19th century; some of the trees along these roads may be survivors from this period. Boultham Park Road is a main road and runs north-south through the Character Area giving good connections to the rest of the city; however, other connections are extremely limited or non-existent, particularly to the east and west. There is a mix of large and smaller urban blocks but overall movement within the Character Area is limited. Away from the traffic noise along Boultham Park Road the Character Area is quiet with little vehicle or pedestrian movement. The continuous building line, public/ private boundary of low walls with brick piers around 75cm in height, and fairly continuous building height give a reasonable sense of enclosure for a suburban Character Area despite the wide streets with grass verges and long front gardens. There is building rhythm in some places from the gabled bay windows and central extensions. Buildings are mainly two-storey semi-detached houses with some detached houses and bungalows and a distinctive red-roofed bungalow development on St. Andrews Drive. There is a wide variety of styles of single fronted semi-detached housing including some with two-storey bay windows and some with central projection with mansard roof. Roofs are hipped or gabled and have slate or pantile covering, varying eaves depths and small chimneys although some houses have no chimney.""",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 18,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,86,

f7c68e35-aeee-4608-9aab-71c2e1254044,LARA RAZ AREA,,City docks 1) wharves along Waterside North east of the wall and the Blackdyke,"Although boats could pass the barrier presented by the putative Stamp End lock, it is clear that some, if not most, of the loading and unloading of boats to and from Boston took place at a dock below the dam, next to the field called Calfcroft, on the edge of the property belonging to St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Abbey York. The exact nature of this facility is very little known and a consolidated piece of documentary research is required, as a matter of priority, to map the various surviving documents against the modern base map. The dock (called the Blackdyke in the 15th century) is likely to have been an inlet, pool, or perhaps even an artificial parallel stream (given that it is called a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádyke‰Û¡ÌÝå») along the north bank of the Witham. The dock itself is likely to be valuable mostly on account of the debris with which it is filled, which will be at least partly water-logged, but the wharves themselves are likely to be of great importance in documenting the rise and fall of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s industrial production. Most such facilities leave archaeological evidence of great importance by way of the remains of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáspillages‰Û¡ÌÝå» of the material imported, and a related site at Short Ferry in Fiskerton parish down the Witham produced an extremely important ceramic collection (White 1984). See also RAZs 9.8.5 & 9.55The wharves around Blackdyke, however, are likely to be merely the continuation of the line of wharves which we know from the Hundred Rolls lined the north side of the road along the Witham bank from here as far west as the city wall. The sequence of construction of the various wharves will be of great interest, especially as our model of the development of the dock suggests that they are unlikely simply to spread eastwards from the city in a chronological fashion.",Summary,"The RAZ is bounded by the modern bank of the Witham on the south side, which is likely to represent the line of the latest medieval water front, perhaps of 12th- or 13th-century date. Then comes the road which is referred to in several documents, and which entered the city to the south of the tower in Green Dragon Yard. North of the road lay the warehouses, known to have been used for storing wool after the middle of the 13th century. It is possible that this zone of river frontage had always been used for warehouses (for storing cloth bound for Boston fair for example), but it is also possible that this Butwerk waterfront had been part of a more mixed economy prior to the 13th century. Information about any changes in the economy of Butwerk‰Û¡ÌÝå»s waterside between the 11th century (when it seems it was founded) and the 13th century would be extremely welcome. The western boundary of the RAZ is taken to be the city wall, but without an understanding of the location of the Blackdyke, the eastern boundary of this RAZ is hard to estimate. An arbitrary line has been chosen due south of the church of the Benedictine Priory, but further documentary research may reveal that it extended further east than this.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.2,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.2,

Indeed the church fabric itself seems to have been in decay since at least 1318 when Bishop Dalderby issued an indulgence to those contributing to its re-edification (Venables 1887-8, 331). The fabric may not have been completely secured, however, as several writers have presumed that St Michael‰Û¡ÌÝå»s was the Wigford church which Leland reported to be ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáin clene ruin‰Û¡ÌÝå» in c.1540. This long period of decay may have an interesting reflection in the archaeological record. Was the whole of the church always roofed, and if not, which parts of it were maintained in usable condition to the last? In other words was the decline managed and if so, how? Given this state of affairs it is not surprising that the church fabric was appropriated by the City Council, and the church property liquidated, relatively early and quickly (in 1535 - Stocker 1990). The process seems to have been efficiently managed by the successor parish - St Peter-at-Gowts - and this may mean that the archaeology of the demolition itself will be of interest.",Summary,The boundaries of the churchyard have been estimated on the basis of early leases and the RAZ follows the boundaries of the plot presumed to represent the medieval churchyard.

It will preserve in its fabric and fittings the evidence for the slight changes which occurred in Quaker observance through the 18th and 19th centuries, and such details will be detected by appropriate recording programmes associated with repair and restoration. The sect remained small in number throughout the Era and, unlike many other non-conformist groupings, evidently did not suffer the distraction of major donations from Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s new industrialists. An account of the development of Quakers in Lincolnshire has been published by Davies (1989). In particular we should be interested in the changing status of women in the sect, and, therefore, the changing uses to which the ‰Û¡ÌÝÌágallery‰Û¡ÌÝå» were put in the 19th and 20th centuries. The burial ground will also be of considerable interest because it will preserve a paleopathological record of the social circumstances of the Quaker community through time.

f888ecff-978c-4d65-89a7-0254f99d97fc,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Cathedral and Close Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Cathedral Character Area is dominated by the cathedral at its centre, built largely during the High Medieval Era [850-1350 AD]. Many buildings face the cathedral around Minster Yard, the majority of which are associated with the cathedral. Together with the cathedral, these buildings form an ecclesiastical centre located on the northern escarpment overlooking the city. Much of the early townscape has survived and as a result the Character Area is a well-preserved example of a High Medieval religious centre, although several of the buildings themselves have been altered since then, especially during the 18th century.The cathedral is much larger in scale than surrounding buildings and its outstanding architectural style, form and detailing make it the most prominent and high status building in the Character Area and surrounding areas. It has also strongly influenced the form and character of the open spaces around it, the street pattern, the aspect of houses facing the cathedral, and the larger irregular buildings and plots to the south and east (including the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace).The townscape has also been strongly influenced by the long history of development in the Character Area from the High Medieval period onwards, particularly in the variety of the form and architectural style of the buildings (including Classical and Gothic), as well as in the shape and size of the building plots. Other earlier developments which still influence the current character include the 14th century Close Wall (including Exchequergate) and the High Medieval Bishops Palace. Exchquergate itself is a landmark building and forms a key link between the cathedral and castle.There is a strong sense of enclosure, including quite large enclosed public spaces and greens, due to the large scale cathedral, the continuous building line of 2-3 storey buildings around Minster Yard and the many long, high stone and brick walls. There are many doorways, narrow lanes and carriageway arches leading from the open spaces around the cathedral through walls or buildings into open spaces, gardens, yards or roads beyond. Trees in the open spaces and gardens around the cathedral form an important part of its setting.The use of natural materials throughout the Character Area, both within buildings and the public realm, is a defining characteristic of the area. Stone in particular, and to a lesser extent brick and timber, creates a congruent townscape that contrasts with surrounding areas which are comparably more varied. There are many views of the cathedral from within the Character Area and there are views of the south escarpment and lower city from the area which are an important part of its character.The cathedral, the wider Character Area, and neighbouring character areas form a key tourist destination for Lincoln and the East Midlands.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 74,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,31,

The sites of all four of the major orders have features of interest which are documented under each case. In the course of the final two centuries of their existence we should be interested in adaptations to the churches and other claustral buildings which may cast light on the changing attitudes of the orders to their rules and to their relationship with the secular world. In the post-Dissolution period these sites retain considerable interest. Their archaeology should cast light on the attitudes of the new secular owners to the old religion; was it deliberately denigrated or were its monuments treated with dignity and respect? In the case of the Carmelite Friary and St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Conduit we may have rare evidence for the latter attitude. In all of these cases we must be aware that the fraternal buildings are likely to have converted for secular uses at the Dissolution. Little is known about these conversions in Lincoln or elsewhere and the chance should be taken to study this important aspect of early modern archaeology as well as the archaeology of these Friaries themselves.We know more about the Lincoln Greyfriary than we do about the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s houses of the other major orders, through two major excavations within the precinct (GLA91, GLB94) and through several studies of the surviving building, now belonging to the city and County Museum Service. There remains much of importance on the site, however, and the results of previous work need to be consolidated into a full account of the institution.In the course of the final two centuries of its existence we should be interested in the development and adaptation of the friary, both the church and the conventual buildings. Changes to such structures should be assessed for their contribution to our understanding of the changing attitudes of the friars to their Rule and to their relationships with the lay public. The church, in particular, will preserve, in its design and furnishing, evidence for the development of late medieval piety and dogma, and the identification of such changes should be a priority in subsequent work.Like the Dominicans, the Franciscans also interested themselves in the water supply and laid conduits into the city, which served as both a public supply and a supply for the house (Stocker 1990). This conduit was almost certainly along the southern boundary of the precinct and should be located and explored. In comparison with Lincoln's other fraternal orders, the Greyfriars had a long precinct wall, which could have been exploited for commercial purposes, fronting on to Clewmarket to the north, Free School Lane to the west and southwards, perhaps, on to Staple Place. It is important for our understanding of the relationships between the friars and the community in which they were set that we understand to what extent they benefited from rents within their precincts, and so archaeological details derived from street fronts here will be of great value.Although studies have been made of the conversion of this building in the later 13th century (Stocker 1984b - RAZ 9.53.4), no efforts have yet been made to elucidate the changes which this building underwent in the 16th century. This is a lacuna, as the building retains ample evidence for thorough-going reconstruction at this time, with the insertion of fireplaces, windows etc. It is, perhaps, the most important standing example of this type of conversion of a monastic building in the county and future repair work on the building must be accompanied by detailed survey work aimed at understanding the process of conversion (a useful series of measured drawings already exists in Padley 1851).

This is, therefore, a rare dedication and one which might suggest a particular political context and date for the foundation. The saint‰Û¡ÌÝå»s passio dates from the reign of Aethelred II and has to be seen in the context of efforts by that king to foster his own political position in the face of challenges from political rivals (Fell 1971; 1978; Yorke 1999, 109-113). These efforts to promote the cult as an expression of loyalty to Aethelred date from the decade or so following Edward‰Û¡ÌÝå»s canonisation in 1001, and this is therefore likely to be the date of any churches given this dedication. Certainly a lord who dedicated a church to Edward after the change of regime in 1015 would have been running the risk of accusations of disloyalty and, given this apparently precise political context for the foundation between 1001 and 1015, this church should be an important target for excavation. If it is true that its dedication represents a political statement of loyalty to the regime of the house of Aethelred, it is perhaps more likely that the church will have been founded by a single lord (rather than a group) and in that case it will present an important contrast with St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (RAZ 9.60.25) just to the north, which we have suggested may have been founded by an elite group (Stocker 2000). The church must have served a very small parish and, consequently, its development history may provide an instructive contrast with those churches which catered to a larger population. Part of the churchyard is crossed by Firth Road and works on services here should not be undertaken without archaeological supervision.",Summary,"The site of the church is known from early leases, and the RAZ follows the outline of the presumed plot (Gilmour and Stocker 1986, fig 3 no. 20).

f9cdb1de-dae8-4783-8540-0ad1aeb1a017,LARA RAZ AREA,,Housing in the lower city,"The street pattern of the lower city of Lincoln is readily susceptible to a plan-form analysis, and we have argued (RAZ 9.22) that the street pattern can be divided into two basic units. The northern unit, on the steeper parts of the hill slope, was occupied in the 15th and 16th centuries by the remnants of the various specialist markets which had been laid out here as early as the 11th century. These markets, it is argued, eventually attracted rows of houses, which fan out down the hill from the south gate, belonging to traders in the markets which filled the adjacent streets, between the extinct lane north of the former church of St John-the-Poor on the west and Danesgate on the east. Several of these buildings from the early modern period survive, ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáThe Harlequin‰Û¡ÌÝå» for example seems to be an agglomeration of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌárow‰Û¡ÌÝå» type properties which meet at a corner. The properties along the west side of The Strait seem to have been of similar character originally (see RAZ 10.22.7). It is also thought likely that several of the other properties fronting on to Steep Hill preserve fragments of the early modern houses and all such fragments must be recorded during the course of repair and reconstruction work - where possible in association with excavation. In the course of such work we need to investigate whether these buildings do have their origins in commercial ‰Û¡ÌÝÌárow‰Û¡ÌÝå» type buildings which served, in effect, as permanent market booths. If so, we need further information explaining the apparent shift from stone construction, (which prevailed until the 13th century - represented today pre-eminently by the Jew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s House, although excavated examples have also been discovered) towards the timber framing which dominates building of the Early Modern Era. If the early modern buildings within this part of the RAZ do turn out to be of this type, we would expect them to change their character markedly when the markets folded one by one, and moved to the High Street north and south of Stonebow. Presumably, at this period these buildings either became simple residences or, away from the Steep Hill axis, were abandoned altogether.To the east of Danesgate, south of the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace, the rectangular block lying on the steep slope in the parish of St Andrew-under-Palace was reported to have fewer than 10 parishioners in 1428 and the archaeological evidence for this abandonment will be of great interest. Similarly, the narrow block of properties between Beaumont Fee and the western city wall, and indeed along the north side of the lost lane north of St John-the-Poor also had fewer than 10 inhabitants and similarly valuable archaeological evidence should be available from these parishes. South of the line formed by Motherby Lane and Danes Terrace Dr Vince has shown that the lower city takes a quite different form (chapter 9a). It is planned around a fairly regular grid of streets, with north-to-south roads on the lines of Free School Lane/Danesgate, Bank Street/Flaxengate, Ermine Street, Hungate/Mint Lane and Beaumont Fee. The east-to-west road in this grid seems to be represented today by Motherby Lane/ St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane/Grantham Street and Park Street/Clasketgate. Dr Vince argues, convincingly, that this grid represents a formalisation of the plan of the Anglo-Scandinavian settlement undertaken a century after the settlement‰Û¡ÌÝå»s original foundation. In this part of the lower city, as elsewhere, the boundary between the High Medieval Era and the Early Modern Era is marked, approximately, by the changeover in building materials for domestic buildings from stone to timber framed construction. A valuable research agenda for the later medieval buildings is provided by Harris (1994), who points out that we need to understand the relationship of public to private space in such structures.

It was the church in the medieval corn market, which was held in the space to the west at the junction of Steep Hill, The Strait and Danes Terrace. Potentially, then, like St John and St Peter, this was the church belonging to another subdivision of the original High Market (RAZ 9.22), and this might lead to the suggestion that it could have been founded by a group of corn merchants rather than by a single lord. The dedication to a prominent Northumbrian saint (eg. Venables 1881, 376-7) might suggest that the church was founded during a period of Northumbrian influence in the city, which might, in its turn suggest that it was founded before the Norman Conquest, or possibly even in the period before the re-conquest of Lincoln by the Wessex kings in 942. The High Medieval Era church is likely to have been a relatively prosperous one, given that a number of 12th-and 13th-century stone houses have been discovered through excavations within the parish, and, of course, the Jew‰Û¡ÌÝå»s House opposite the church site still stands. Although the church was closed by the Act of Union of Parishes in 1549 and the parish merged with St Michael, the graveyard continued in use as an overspill graveyard, and is marked as such on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map. This means that the graveyard population does not benefit from a definite terminus ante quem. Even so, the population is likely to be of considerable interest and should be considered as a single population and not piecemeal.",Summary,"The site of the burial ground in 1842 is presumed to represent the full extent of the medieval graveyard, with the exception of the property on the north-west angle which is presumed to be a post-medieval encroachment on to the medieval churchyard site.",Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,9.60.37,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,9.60.37,

fa0855bf-2112-490c-a8f7-088480fe3637,LARA RAZ AREA,,The Clewmarket,"The Clewmarket or thread market stands to one side of all the other known markets of High Medieval Lincoln. It is first reported in the later 13th century, when it occurs as the discriminator for the church of Holy Trinity by the Greyfriars (Cameron 1985, 21, 114-5). The church is known to stand on the eastern side of the lower part of Flaxengate (south of Clasketgate) along the base of an awkwardly shaped triangle of land which extends to the east towards Clasketgate gate. This awkward triangle is not an obvious shape for a layout of dwelling plots and it seems likely that this was the site of Clewmarket itself. The market was probably held in the church yard itself and the church is certainly said to be ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáin‰Û¡ÌÝå» the Clewmarket on several occasions. In this respect, the market is similar to a number of others in the city (see list of examples in the High Market - RAZ 9.22 - for example) and this might be an argument for the market‰Û¡ÌÝå»s early foundation. Dr Vince would like to see both the church and the market as evidence for the re-planning of the lower city in the 10th century (chapter 9a), and this remains a possibility, but it is also possible to see the Clewmarket as a later feature in the townscape superimposed on the early Anglo-Scandinavian plan. First we have to ask why thread was not amongst the wide range of materials (including drapery) which were sold higher up the hillside - perhaps originally in a single market and then, subsequently, in a number of street markets. This might imply that both thread, and the specialist market dealing which dealt with it, was a late-comer in terms of the foundation dates of Lincoln markets. Although, of course, the market could previously have been used for more general purposes, we might ask whether thread only became necessary in great quantities once the cloth trade had become industrialised in the 12th century. If so that might suggest that this was a specialist market dealing in bulk quantities of thread, presumably imported (perhaps by water) for use by the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s weavers. Another indication that the market might be a later feature in the townscape than the initial Anglo-Scandinavian grid is its proximity to the Anglo-Scandinavian pottery kilns known to have existed on the south side of Silver Street. We can presume that traders would be unwilling to set up stall in the smoke of the pottery kilns and therefore that the market might have been later in date than the kilns. Further research in the RAZ should attempt to reconcile these somewhat differing views of the date and origin of the market.",Summary,"The RAZ for the market includes the broad street itself, with the intention of managing deposits and structures related to the market itself.

The Character Area forms part of the much larger Ermine West housing development and shares a pattern of gently curving streets and cul-de-sacs with that area. The bungalows face on to the streets and are also orientated to face the street on corners.Most of the houses are painted in white or pastel colours and have had replacement windows and doors fitted; some have also been rendered and re-roofed. The many privet garden hedges of around 1m in height between plots as well as along plot fronts are a strong characteristic of the area. Houses and gardens are generally well maintained and there are active frontages throughout the area. The hedges, planted gardens, mature trees in some gardens and wide grass verges on junctions give a green appearance to the Character Area.The small central urban block makes it easy to move about within the Character Area although the large block to the east limits movement in that direction.

fa0aa478-d1aa-44c9-aeeb-80967d58dac2,LARA RAZ AREA,,Textile industries,"Strangely, perhaps, given its location in a wool-producing area, Lincoln did not develop a rejuvenated textile industry in the 19th century. This may be because the first phase of industrialisation in Lincoln was based around water transport and a substantial commodity transported was Lincolnshire wool. Consequently, we might argue, by the time technology would allow textile manufacture on an industrial scale in Lincoln itself, the local wool producers already had established markets in the West Riding and elsewhere inland. This is an important question which requires further investigation both amongst the documentary records of the textile industry and in the buildings and structures associated with it. There were, however, some small scale textile works in 19th-century Lincoln of which the most famous was Singleton and Flint, established as early as 1803 as waterproof cover manufacturers, using flax (Wright 1982, 72, 144). Their works were in Newland Street West. The works presumably relied, initially, on the transport of both agricultural goods and engineered machines by both canal and railway (both of which would have required tarpaulins). Future work on the site should investigate the factory‰Û¡ÌÝå»s power sources, especially in the early period and also on the evidence for the supply of the raw materials. These presumably came in by river, initially, although supply may have been by railway after c.1850.A different category of textile manufacture but closely related in its use to the tarpaulins of Singleton and Co., was rope production. By the 1840s there were many ropewalks in the city, listed in directories, and an example is shown in the centre of the lower city in Beaumont Fee on Padley‰Û¡ÌÝå»s 1842 map. Jeykll‰Û¡ÌÝå»s chemical plant in Carholme Road (RAZ 11.43) was built on the site of the ropewalk belonging to his partner, Mr Singleton and at least six further ropewalks are noted on the 1st edition O.S. One was a ropewalk west of the High Street in St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish and a second north of Princess Street. The modern street Rope Walk is named from a rope manufacturer located alongside the railway west of St Mark‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Lane. A ropewalk is marked on the 1st edition O.S. south of Cornhill and another north-east of Clayton and Shuttleworth‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Stamp End works. This last (owned by William Rainforth who subsequently became an iron-master himself) is so remotely located from other enterprises it is tempting to suggest that this installation made ropes mostly for Clayton and Shuttleworth‰Û¡ÌÝå»s. It probably began life making ropes for the Shuttleworth shipping business out of which the firm grew (Herridge 1999, No.5237) (RAZ 11.36). The ropewalk shown on the same map next to the quarry east of Nettleham Road is less likely to have supplied ropes for the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s engineering industry, but it may have been supplying the quarries next door (RAZ 11.41.4). Most of these establishments seem to have been open-air walks with structures located at either end of the rope for winding and platting the threads. It is not clear from the map whether any of the winders were mechanised and, indeed little research seems to have been done on the development and mechanisation of rope manufacture. We should be interested in the techniques of rope-winding and how and when that process became mechanised. We might also ask where the raw materials for rope-making came from, especially in the 18th century, and by what means it was transported to the city. It seems unlikely that much of the output of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s ropewalks was carried out of the county for sale, but there would have been a considerable demand from farms and other businesses in Lincolnshire.More exotic was the silk-throwing mill founded in a central location on Brayford Wharf East by Messrs. Patterson of Nottingham in 1871 (Williamson 1890, 147). This mill represents a relatively rare category of mill, and the buried remains are an important resource that can help us understand the development of t",Summary,The various RAZ elements are mapped following the sites‰Û¡ÌÝå» depictions on the 1887 O.S. map editions and a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.39,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.39,

The Speed map shows that, before canalisation, the Little Gowts Drain (south of the Great Gowt) was actually a tributary, leaving the Witham slightly upstream of its companion and rejoining the Great Gowts east of Ermine Street, and before the combined channel flowed into the Nichorpool. Today the Little Gowt is culverted beneath Ermine Street, but it is likely that important structures relating to medieval (and potentially earlier) crossing points on the line of the main street survive. These are likely to be of importance, not just because their construction will be an important indicator of transport, and therefore occupation activity in Wigford and in the city more generally, but also because they are likely to be waterlogged, offering the prospect of well preserved wooden remains. The Speed map shows, however, an arched stone bridge like that over the Great Gowt, and this may also be a medieval stone bridge. It is possible that these bridges might have been fortified at various stages throughout their lives, at least temporarily, and any evidence for the fortification of these bridges will be particularly valuable.The bridging point of Little Gowt may be better preserved than that of Great Gowt. The more northerly Dyke was crossed by two single-carriageway arched stone bridges, which may themselves have been of medieval date and one or other abutment should survive in the ditch side to one side of the modern dual carriageway bridge (built shortly after 1806 - Hill 1966, 175) (RAZ 11.6.4). The bridges at both Great Gowt and Little Gowt seem to have been created alongside fords. Such fords also have considerable archaeological interest in their own right and are often paved, providing a useful dating horizon.",Summary,The RAZ is flanked by the churchyard of Holy Cross Wigford (RAZ 9.60.16) on its western side. The relationship between the two structures is of great interest and importance and therefore the two RAZ boundaries are intended to have a substantial overlap.

It would have always been an area of scrubby woodland on poor, sandy, soils as it was in the Iron Age and in the Roman Colonia Eras (RAZ 5. 9, RAZ 7.3). This woodland would have been a valuable resource and may have been the location of, or the stimulation for, woodland industries such as smelting or pottery manufacture. It is conceivable that such operations were in operation during the Roman Military occupation and they may even have been started by the conquerors, although the evidence found to date suggest that they did not begin until later in the Roman period (RAZ 7.3). Even so, these valuable natural resources were located close to the new fortress and as such one might expect that they were contained within the territorium (see RAZ 6.18 for discussion). The capture of environmental evidence will be the first step towards identifying the significance of this component. The surrounding peat may preserve more important environmental deposits than the sands and gravels themselves.

fb7c7716-3106-4192-bf61-bff5ee0b32dc,LARA RAZ AREA,,Police stations,"Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s first police station was established next to the Sessions House, in part of the City Gaol (RAZ 11.64, 11.67), presumably shortly after the passage of the Municipal Reform Act of 1835 which gave the new Corporation control over the police (Wright 1982, 116). A police office is recorded there in 1849 (RCHME 1997). It is not known how much was used of the prison building (which had been rebuilt in 1844-5), although the present complex is remarkably well-preserved. This building requires full recording during repairs or alterations with the aim of elucidating its structural development and relating that development to the growth of the Lincoln police force. To the south, and within the RAZ, is the Chief Constable‰Û¡ÌÝå»s House, presumably also built in the 1840s. This building provides a useful statement of the social status of the Chief Constable and results from detailed fabric recording should (consequently) be compared with houses in RAZ 11.28 to establish the relative social status he was originally expected to occupy.Shortly after its foundation in 1856 the newly formed County Constabulary established a police station in Wigford, north of St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Guildhall (Wright 1982, 232). The standing buildings date from 1860 (Hill ed. 2000, 29) and, although now used as shops, they survive in good condition. They incorporate a yard at the rear with several original out-buildings which are of as much interest as the main block as they will have housed policemen and early transport as well as other equipment. Subsequently a second County Police Station was established on the corner of St Catherine's Road and Newark Road. These complexes are both important survivals from the origins of the police force locally and, in both plan and details, they will be eloquent of both changing police procedures and of their developing aspirations. In addition to the two main police stations there are two surviving city police houses, which also served as sub-stations, when need arose. These are, firstly, the house that faces the modern Swine Green roundabout, south of Sincil Dyke, and, secondly, the house west of the Fire Station at 39 Church Lane. These two buildings, which both date from the late 19th century, seem to be located in very similar, almost symbolic, locations, at the visible north and south entrances to the city. Is that just a co-incidence? Both surviving houses are of considerable interest as their layout, and potentially also some detailing, will preserve evidence for their original intended function. From their plans, for example, we should be able to tell to what extent the early police constable was expected to live with his work. Both should have recording programmes in association with repair and development.",Summary,The various RAZ elements are mapped following the sites‰Û¡ÌÝå» boundaries depicted on various O.S. map editions and they include a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.51,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.51,

fbb6abbc-54f5-4635-82ed-c08fe5041ad5,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Chapel Lane Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌThe Chapel Lane Character Area consists of a small area on top of the escarpment, north of the Castle that has Chapel Lane running through it. There are four main 'sites' leading off from Chapel Lane: the water tower and its surrounding gardens, a cemetery and two Modern [1967-2008] housing developments, St. Clements Court and Lillicrap Court. In general these sites are separated from the road by a strong boundary and are enclosed on all sides, although Lillicrap Court has one side that is open on to the road. This is partly the result of each separate area being developed for different uses at different times. High site boundaries create quite a strong sense of enclosure, including high (6-8 feet) walls along both sides of the road with single entry points into plots. These boundaries provide occasional glimpses into the areas beyond. This is particularly the case on the southern side of Chapel Lane where there is a stone wall with a gated entrance into the cemetery, followed by a brick wall with decorative dentilated brickwork, followed by another stone wall that may have been associated with earlier buildings as it contains openings that have later been filled in with brick. Finally, there is a brick wall, probably 19th century or earlier, either side of the entrance into St. Clements. On the northern side of Chapel Lane the boundary is also high towards the west and this creates quite a strong sense of enclosure. There are cast-iron railings around the water tower and a formal entrance set back from the pavement with stone gateposts, iron gates and cast-iron letters spelling out 'Wickham Gardens', the name of the open space area around the base of the water tower. Mature trees are also a strong feature of the Character Area as they line the railings and walls along the road and break up the street scene.Occupation of the Character Area extends as far back as the Roman Military Era [60-90 AD]. The northern boundary of the Character Area and the western boundary of Westgate Junior School roughly follow the northern wall of the upper Roman City which continued as a defensive feature until the Early Modern Era [1350-1750 AD]. A wall still follows the line of the former Roman wall and this has influenced the division of the Character Area from neighbouring residential areas to the north and west. This has made it quite separate and a result, quite quiet in comparison with these adjoining areas. West Bight footpath which runs north to south along the eastern boundary of the Character Area may also follow the line of a Roman road. A field boundary along the western edge of Lillicrap Court can be seen on maps from Early Modern [1350-1750 AD] or earlier date, suggesting that there was a period of decline when this area was returned to farming. However, subsequent growth in the Early Industrial Period [1750-1845 AD] led to its piecemeal redevelopment including the cemetery. Earthworks in the north west of the Character Area identify the eastern boundary of a former reservoir constructed in the Post-Railway Expansion Period [1846-1868 AD] which was replaced by the water tower in 1911 that now dominates the Character Area. Number 51 Chapel Lane is the only extant example of residential development from the Late Victorian/Edwardian Period [1869-1919 AD]. The rest was comprehensively redeveloped as Lillicrap Court in the Modern Period [1967-2009 AD]. The other residential site, St. Clements, was built on a former Council yard in the 1980s. Few of the buildings in the Character Area face directly on to Chapel Lane. The water tower is set in the centre of its plot with gardens around it, Lillicrap Court is positioned adjacent to the road but has a broken building line so that the fronts of the buildings are staggered along the road, creating space for areas of planting along the footpath. Number 51 Chapel Lane is also set back from the road. The two blocks of houses are set around private internal spaces which means that the majority of properties do not face on to the road. The water tower is a landmark feature in the Character Area. It dominates the skyline due to its height and vertical emphasis. This square building was given an elaborate ashlar facing to respond to the architecture of the Castle. It has a number of decorative features such as fleur-de-lys in relief and a central bracketed canopy on each side.With the exception of number 51 Chapel Lane, the properties in this area are contained in two sites, Lillicrap Court and St. Clements. The buildings are generally one to two storeys high, constructed in red brick, contain two flats in each unit, are set within large plots with open space around them and have a staggered building line. Only the front of Lillicrap Court faces on to the street, with the rest facing on to internal courtyards or the open space that extends along the western and northern sides of Lillicrap Court. Both developments have a very irregular building footprint in comparison with neighbouring residential areas where houses tend to have a uniform building line and a stronger relationship to the street. Variations between the two developments include the extent to which the units are connected. All the buildings in Lillicrap Court are joined to at least one other unit, creating an overall building footprint in a 'Y' shape. In comparison, although there are blocks in St. Clements Court there is greater variety with some buildings being individual and others being in blocks of two or three. The St. Clements buildings are in a darker colour brick, have brown casement windows with terracotta tiled window sills and porches over the doors, whereas the Lillicrap Court buildings have white casement windows, some with concrete surrounds and first-floor windows positioned directly beneath the eaves. The properties in St. Clements have deeper eaves supported by corbels and a raised parapet on the gable ends. The eaves in Lillicrap Court are shallower and have less decoration. There are several large public open spaces within the four main sites in this area and these too are partly concealed from view from Chapel Lane. There is a grassed area both to the front and rear of the water tower, and also a children's play area. On the other side of the road a single gate provides a view into the cemetery. Although the grassed area along the western edge of Lillicrap Court opens on to Chapel Lane, it is not possible to see from here that it also extends all the way along the northern boundary of Lillicrap Court too. In many places there is no access from Chapel Lane Character Area into neighbouring areas or between plots within the Character Area but the road and West Bight footpath provide good connections to Bailgate further east and Westgate further south. The enclosed nature of the area means that there are limited views out of the Character Area, though views on to the water tower are prominent.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 59,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,21,

It is of brick but intended to be a replica (extended one bay - architect W.G. Watkins) of the church of St Peter-at-Arches originally built in 1719-24 (RAZs 10.60.44 & 11.91.14). Consequently the new church derived many of its stone architectural details from the demolished church (Anon. c. 1933). This is an important group of early 18th-century architectural and sculptural details and features, which require careful recording should they be repaired or replaced. The church also contains an important collection of mainly 12th-century architectural fragments both loose within the building and built into modern architectural features. These stones were found in the fabric of St Peter-at-Arches in 1933 and might represent evidence for the medieval St Peter (RAZ 9.60.44). However it is reliably stated (Hill 1966, 64) that the stone for the 18th-century building came from Roche Abbey, so there is a possibility that these fragments originated there instead. Further detailed research of the stones at St Giles should settle the issue. The church‰Û¡ÌÝå»s layout and fittings, however, are more reminiscent of 1933 than 1733 and thus, for example, the orientation of the church is reversed. This is an important example of liturgical thinking of the period between the wars and records should be made before alterations are made.",Summary,The RAZ includes the church plot mapped on the modern O.S. map.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.92.4,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.92.4,

fd275e29-c4dc-47fb-8a03-6da46716bba6,LARA RAZ AREA,,Wood processing industries,"Wood was a vital component in Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s engineering industry as threshing machines and many other products had wooden components. Presumably all the timber had to be imported and, for this, canals might have been especially useful, even after the arrival of the railway. Ruston‰Û¡ÌÝå»s developed their own wood-working yard east of High Street in Wigford south of Firth Road, but the other major manufacturers must have bought much of their wooden components from other businesses. Consequently a comparison between the remains of some of these companies and the Ruston‰Û¡ÌÝå»s work will be of considerable interest. Is it possible to say which method of supply was the more effective? It ought to be possible, at the least, to see how closely the prosperity of the wood-working businesses matched that of the heavy engineers.Newsum‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Joinery Works began in Broadgate in 1856, moved to Pelham Street in 1885, (Herridge 1999, No.5251) and probably supplied both Robey‰Û¡ÌÝå»s and Clayton and Shuttleworth‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, but, perhaps because of the development of the new works at New Boultham during the First World War, they moved to Carholme Road in 1918 (Herridge 1999, No.5245). This works was linked to the LNER at West Holmes junction by a single-track railway crossing the Fossdyke by means of a drawbridge (Herridge 1999, No.5075). The firm manufactured a wide range of timber products, especially for building and construction. Some of Newsums‰Û¡ÌÝå» original buildings survive on the site, including an all-timber building and shops to the south. Presumably the prospect of better communications both in and out must have also been influential in prompting the plant‰Û¡ÌÝå»s move. The timber building, in particular, should be recorded during repairs or alterations as it was a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáshowcase‰Û¡ÌÝå» for the firm‰Û¡ÌÝå»s skills. It is not known what use Newsum‰Û¡ÌÝå»s made of machines in their production processes and this requires research, but at Rushton and Dawkins, Steam Wood-tuners at 261 High Street (Herridge 1999, No.5248) such machines were plentiful. According to an account of 1893/4, motive power was a 6-hp vertical steam engine and the workshops contained boiler, saws, lathes etc. and there were facilities for stone turning. Rushton and Dawkins made steam-moulded components for carriage-building and they were also turners and manufacturers of wooden handles for agricultural and domestic tools, and cart fittings - many of which must have been used in the Lincoln tool-making plants. They were on this site by 1887 and buildings at the rear of 261 High Street may be the firm's workshops. Evidence for the various machines employed may be recovered during careful recording in the fabric. The 1st edition O.S. records a large timber yard at 102 High Street and a wood-working enterprise called a ‰Û¡ÌÝÌásawing planing and moulding mill‰Û¡ÌÝå» to the north of Portland Street near its eastern end. This shop must also have been integrated into the production processes of the big city engineering firms and, being close to the main gate of Robey‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Globe Works, it may have been especially connected with them.",Summary,The various RAZ elements are mapped following the sites‰Û¡ÌÝå» depictions on the 1887 O.S. map and including a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.4,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.4,

These newly assembled aircraft needed to be tested in the air and formally received into the RFC, and so two aerodromes were established, one on Bracebridge Heath (outside the modern city boundary) and the other at West Common. The latter was designated No.4 Aircraft Acceptance Park and although it had turf runways, it was provided with four brick hangars (Wright 1989, 77). There has been considerable archaeological interest in the typological development of hangars at this period and the earthworks and buried remains of these examples should be studied to see where they belong in the sequence. There were also timber and canvas structures, which may be detectable through study of the earthworks. The test pilots were accommodated in the grandstand of the Racecourse (RAZ 11.77) and the murals there date from this occupation.

But even though its parish was in severe decline from the 13th century, it did not mean, however, that it was without support; three chantries were established here between 1340 and 1351 (Venables 1887-8, 337) and assessing the archaeological remains of these institutions should be a priority in future work. This apparent contrast between the declining population of the parish and the support for the church amongst the elite is a matter of some interest and the exploration of the social class of the graveyard population could form the basis for an interesting study. Unfortunately the church site was used as an over-spill graveyard for St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish in the 19th century, but, with luck it will prove possible to separate the two burial populations. St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s should, at the least preserve a good example of the fabric and liturgical arrangements of a city church at the eve of the reformation and so might help cast light on the question of whether or not support for the Old Religion was in decline at this time (Duffy 1992). The church was united with St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s by the 1549 Act, but, unusually, there is no record of the city attempting to liquidate the assets. This raises the possibility that the church passed into the hands of the vicar of St Martin‰Û¡ÌÝå»s, or the prebendary, whose use of it is unrecorded, so the use of the site in the post-Reformation period should be investigated in future archaeological work.",Summary,"The site of the churchyard is known and the RAZ aims to include the whole of the known area.

fed18aeb-5648-4daf-9848-f17210be6339,LARA RAZ AREA,,"Presbyterian, Independent and Congregational Chapels","There were several conventicles of Presbyterians and Independents in the city by the late 18th century although most have obscure histories (Hill 1966, 68-9). The best documented, however, is that which began as early as 1672 and met in the chapel, built in c.1725 on the east side of High Street, at the corner with Monson Street, in St Peter-at-Gowts parish (RAZ 10.65). This group called themselves Presbyterian in 1719, but they were Independent by 1774 (Ibid.) and the congregation became Unitarian in 1837 (Hill 1974, 184; Hill 1966, 68). The chapel is a rare building type, and its alterations will represent the changing aspirations of the dissenting community; each alteration should be analysed as a potential expression of changing creeds and should, therefore, be recorded in detail during the course of repair works. The RAZ includes the whole plot on which the chapel stands on the presumption that the surrounding ground may have been used for burial, or for other purposes associated with the conventicle, which may have left an impression in the archaeological record. A second Independent group had formed in 1819 in a building in Tanners Lane. This group had their origins in a group of Baptists who had succeeded from the Zion Chapel (Hill 1974, 185) and the remains of this chapel, now converted into industrial buildings, survive. They represent an important (and now rare) survival of an early dissenters' chapel in Lincoln and should be fully recorded during repairs or alterations. In 1840 an offshoot of this community, now calling themselves Congregationalist, moved to a new purpose-built chapel in Newland. The Tanners Lane chapel site and buildings, consequently, offer the prospect of understanding the development of this group of dissenters over an extended period of time. It will give us an insight into the changing doctrinal position taken by this particular group of dissenters and may help explain the origins of the Lincoln Congregationalists in the Calvinistic Baptist sect. It would be useful to know, for example, when the baptismal tank ceased to be the structural focus of the chapel. Although the sect had moved to new premises it seems that occasional services were held in the chapel until 1907.The new chapel in Newland of 1840 was built to the designs of the architect Fenton of Chelmsford (Hill 1974, 142, 185-6). The Congregationalists thrived in the central part of the 19th century, and in 1876 the chapel was converted to become the Congregational School and a new chapel was built on the plot to the west (to designs by the architects Bellamy and Hardy). Some of the funds for the new work came from Joseph Ruston, who was a member of the congregation, and the possibility that he may have influenced the architectural details of the new chapel should be investigated. Such influential patronage must, at least, have lain behind the prosperity and influence of the Congregationalists in the Victorian city. There were additional chapels, or mission rooms, built in Far Newland (in upper Gresham Street), the eastern end of Monks Road (on the corner of Belmont Street) and, in 1913, in St Botolph‰Û¡ÌÝå»s parish (on the east side of High Street between Spencer Street and Sincil Dyke). All of these existing buildings will retain evidence in their fabric and fittings not just for the rapid growth of Congregationalism in the city through the 19th and into the 20th century, but for the development of their liturgy and beliefs. Recording work should therefore be carried out during phases of repair and alteration.

Most of the current townscape dates from the Inter-War Period (1919-1945) with a few later houses. Boultham Park Road was part of a private drive from High Street to Boultham Hall in the 19th century; some of the trees along the road may be survivors from this period. The gridiron pattern street layout has been influenced by the boundaries of the enclosed fields on which they were built. Housing in the Character Area mainly consists of semi-detached two-storey houses of the Inter-War Period [1919-1945] built in red brick, many with a harled first floor. The houses are in a variety of styles including some with a distinctive ‰Û¡ÌÝÌácross‰Û¡ÌÝå» detail on the faÌÎå_ade. Housing styles are generally repeated over blocks of approximately half a street. The tree-lined streets, continuous building line and near-continuous public/private boundary combine to give a good sense of enclosure for a suburb and there are active frontages throughout the Character Area. There is more open space in the western part of the Character Area where the tight urban streets open out to large grassed areas although the surrounding large urban blocks limit movement. Although there are high volumes of vehicle and pedestrian traffic along Boultham Park Road the rest of the Character Area is quiet with little through traffic. There are good links to surrounding areas and the rest of the city to the north and south via Boultham Park Road; however, connectivity to the east and west is virtually non-existent due to impermeable boundaries formed by the school and housing development.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 36,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,79,

ff5749a9-9ae3-4f4e-bfad-ddf8bebdf5fb,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Lee Road & Queensway Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌLee Road and Queensway Character Area is an inner city residential suburb located between Greetwell Road to the south and Nettleham Road to the north, with the main Wragby Road running through the centre of the area. Much of the Character Area remained as open land until the end of the Late Victorian/Edwardian period. Elements of its former open agricultural character are preserved within a built townscape that illustrates Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s expansion and redevelopment during the late 19th and 20th centuries. Much of the suburb is composed of single individual property build units constructed during the Late Victorian/Edwardian and Inter-war periods. The style and form of houses within the area varies considerably, resulting in a constantly changing character along many streets. However, there are a small number of larger development units, which are more coherent in character, along some cul-de-sacs. Properties are built towards the front of spacious rectangular plots orientated perpendicular to the road. The depth and width of plots often varies along streets, leading to an irregular pattern of houses within their plots. Boundaries to the front of plots are highly varied in style and material, and are frequently tall in height, leading to an increased sense of enclosure and inactivity. Houses are detached or semi-detached and almost entirely two storeys in height and between two to five bays in width. The majority are constructed of a red coloured brick laid in stretcher bond, although a handful of earlier buildings are constructed of stone. Houses have active frontages with doors and windows facing the street creating a feeling of vitality and security along streets. In general, houses are plain in style, with few small-scale decorative features; instead, houses appear to be differentiated through variations in their structural form, roof construction, and larger scale decoration including applied timber framing, rendering, and tiling. Several houses have decorative features which are often associated with specific architectural styles or movements. Many of these decorative elements are contemporary with the period of construction, such as the Arts and Craft style, however a number of decorative features (e.g. Mock Tudor applied timber framing) and entire buildings, are retrospective in style.Lincoln Christ‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Hospital School is a landmark building in the area. The school is located at the front of a large rectangular plot facing onto Wragby Road, with playing fields to the rear. The front of the building is largely screened by a series of mature trees and planting. The building is built of brick with stone dressings, and is highly ornate in style. A large proportion of the Character Area consists of open space, the majority of which is playing fields. However a large amount of open space is made up of spacious mature garden plots to the rear of, or surrounding, residential properties. Views are generally limited to those along streets. Mature trees along streets and within gardens result in a suburban feeling throughout much of the area. Although quiet for much of the day, roads are used by motorists to travel between the main radial roads, particularly during the rush-hour period.Historical development of current townscape character Lee Road and Queensway Character Area lies on top of the limestone ridge to the northeast of the former Roman and Medieval walled cities. Much of the Character Area remained as open land until the end of the Late Victorian/Edwardian period [1869-1919 AD]. Elements of its former open agricultural character are preserved within a built townscape that illustrates Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s expansion and redevelopment during the 19th and 20th centuries.Upper parts of the northern scarp have had a defensive role since the founding of Lincoln during the Roman Military Era, when a Roman legionary fortress was constructed. Wragby Road, which runs through the centre of the Character Area, follows the line of a Roman Road constructed during the Roman Military period. It is probable that from the Roman Military Period land in the Character Area was part of the early city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáterritorium‰Û¡ÌÝå», a swathe of land surrounding major Roman fortresses in which agricultural production and services were dedicated to the service of the legion. The area may have been a focus for small-scale open limestone quarrying, probably in the form of localised areas of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌádigging‰Û¡ÌÝå» along the summit of the escarpment. Evidence for open cast quarrying which probably occurred later in the High Medieval [850-1350 AD] and Early Modern [1350-1750 AD] periods, is observable in sharp changes in topography, such as in the southwest of the area.It is likely that, during the High Medieval [850-1350 AD] and Early Modern [1350-1750 AD] Eras, much of the land in the Character Area remained open either as agricultural fields or grazed heath. Much of the area was probably part of the City‰Û¡ÌÝå»s North and East Fields, and may have been farmed in common by residents of Lincoln. At some point during the Early Modern period, land within the area is likely to have become enclosed, probably through a series of piecemeal agreements and exchanges between residents of Lincoln with common rights to farm the fields. Unenclosed parts of North field were later enclosed by an Act of Parliament in 1803, which stipulated the enclosure of many of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s open fields. Field boundaries associated with either phase of enclosure survive in the current townscape, notably in the orientation of streets and housing plots, such as the rear plot boundaries of Numbers 2 to 24 Egerton Road and the northeast/southwest running boundary dividing the playing fields to the rear of Christ‰Û¡ÌÝå»s‰Û¡ÌÝå» Hospital School. The Early Industrial stone built farmhouse and buildings along Wragby Road survive as a testament to the former agricultural character of the area. The farms are probably partially constructed from stone taken from the High Medieval St. Giles Hospital, which was formerly located in the same area. The east, west and south plot boundaries of the former hospital site are retained in the alignment of Lee Road, Wragby Road, and the western plot boundaries of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáGreywalls‰Û¡ÌÝå» and Numbers 7-11 Auden Close respectively.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 64,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,17,

By 1263 it was united with St Mary-le-Wigford, which parish was thenceforward to provide a curate (RAZ 9.60.35; Hill 1948, 138). The church itself continued in use as a chapel of ease to St Mary into the 14th century, and in 1395 a papal relaxation was given to all those who visited it (Hill 1948, 286). Venables reports that there were bequests to an anchoress here in 1391 and 1396 (1887-8, 341), but the 1391 reference certainly refers to St Andrew Wigford (RAZ 10.60.19) (ed. Gibbons 1888, 76) and that of 1396 may do so also. The parish had fewer than 10 inhabitants in 1428 (Hill 1948, 287) and is not heard of again as an independent entity. The archaeology of such minor churches is just as interesting as that of their more important fellows, and here there is the added interest created by the demotion of the church to chapel status and, evidently its continuation at this lower level for a century and a half. The ritual layout of the chapel after the transfer of the parochial centre to St Mary‰Û¡ÌÝå»s will be a matter of considerable interest, and will provide rare information about the way in which such chapels were used. Did it retain its font for example? The guild of ‰Û¡ÌÝÌáSt Mary who stands over little St Hugh‰Û¡ÌÝå» was established either here or in St Cuthbert‰Û¡ÌÝå»s (or in both places) in 1363 (Westlake 1919, 166-75; Hill 1948,229) and, if here, this may imply that the chapel contained subsidiary altars - a question that can be tested archaeologically.",Summary,"The site of the graveyard was said by Edward Willson to be represented by a plot of land still in the possession of St Mary-le-Wigford in 1823 (Cathedral Portfolio K, f27).

ff93a0b8-7d91-419c-a55c-ff38fc42682b,LTA CHARACTER AREA,,Outer Circle Road Industrial Character Area,"‰Û¡ÌÝÌOuter Circle Industrial Character Area is a mixed-use area on the eastern fringe of the city, accessed from Wragby Road, Greetwell Road and Monks Road which are major east-west arterial roads into and out of the city. Retail units are primarily aligned along Outer Circle Road while commercial and industrial buildings are situated off Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Road/Dean‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Road and on the Allenby Industrial Estate. A residential development is under construction in 2009 and differs from the rest of the area in many ways. The orientations of both Wragby Road and Greetwell Road have their origins in the Roman period, and are the earliest surviving features in the current townscape. Extensive Post-war and Modern industrial development has over-written much of the former rural character of the area, although some traces of field boundaries and areas of former extraction have been retained in the townscape. Much of the area was redeveloped from former ironstone quarrying to industrial use during the second half of the 20th century. Ongoing redevelopment of industrial areas in the south of the Character Area for residential housing demonstrates a second phase of regeneration in the area. The contrast of industrial and residential uses illustrates a successive stage of Lincoln‰Û¡ÌÝå»s growth as the city expands towards its rural fringe.The area is made up of large urban blocks accessed from cul-de-sacs or circular roads mainly leading off Outer Circle Road and Allenby Road. Plots are large and contain either one or more detached buildings, or a row of attached buildings, sometimes arranged around a courtyard. These large plots have made it popular with large retail uses such as Tesco whose visitors generally come by car. Along Outer Circle Road and Dean‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Road/Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Road there is a coarse grain of large buildings positioned towards the centre of their plots surrounded by extensive car parking and yards. Allenby Road Industrial Estate and Monks Road have smaller plots and smaller buildings resulting in a finer grain of development. Properties are a tall single storey or two storeys in height. The low density, horizontal building emphasis, large areas of open space within plots and rural views all combine to give the area a low sense of enclosure. Buildings are either built of solid brick or steel frame with an outer shell. A high proportion of the solid brick examples tend to be on the Allenby Estate as these were part of an earlier phase of development. Building decoration is limited on industrial and retail buildings, and mainly confined to the colour and moulding of the cladding, signage and porches. More variation can be found on office buildings, some of which have rendered faÌÎå_ades and brightly coloured window frames. Residential development off Monks Road includes blocks of flats and short rows of attached houses. The development is high in density compared with the rest of the Character Area.Open spaces include extensive areas of car parking, yards and deep grass verges. Several stretches of road have tall planted boundaries with mature trees, particularly along Greetwell Road. Trees along pavements break up the built environment. There are also a number of gap sites awaiting redevelopment. Parking is a key feature of the area. Despite the extensive areas of parking within plots, cars are often parked along the road and on verges.Public/private boundaries tend to be low around retail and office properties such as planted borders and areas of mown grass that merge with public verges while those around industrial buildings tend to have high security fencing around their plots.From several places in the Character Area there are glimpses of the Cathedral Spires but rural views are more common, both over rural agricultural land to the east and over the South Escarpment to the south, emphasising the fringe location of the Character Area.‰Û¡ÌÝå",Summary,,,,Lincoln Townscape Assessment,LTA 55,Character Area,,,,,,,,LTA Character Areas.shp,Reference_,22,

Changes to the plan and fittings of this church in the early 19th century would be of considerable interest, as they will illustrate the impact of the early 19th-century doctrinal debates on the parish. The church was replaced, however, on a new site within the graveyard (where the original medieval church had been located) in 1855-6 (architect S.S. Tuelon). The new church is a characteristically eccentric design, and all the more valuable for that, but it also preserves within its fabric evidence for the original decoration and layout, which will illustrate the new doctrinal climate, about 20 years earlier than most of the Lincoln city church rebuildings. Further research might be able to explain why this parish - relatively marginal though it was - was one of the earliest in the city to be rebuilt. Was this the influence of the Bishop‰Û¡ÌÝå»s Palace next door, or were the reasons to do with the initial phases of expansion of the city‰Û¡ÌÝå»s population? Burials from this graveyard, where interments took place until the 1850s, will be particularly helpful in assessing whether the population benefited from the social and medical advances of the Industrial Era or whether, conversely, they suffered a deterioration in their circumstances. Results from this burial population should be compared with those from similar graveyards across the city.

These pits may have owed their origin to City Council initiatives in the 17th century and the establishment of a kiln on the site of the former St Faith‰Û¡ÌÝå»s churchyard (RAZ 10.41.1). Allison‰Û¡ÌÝå»s yard, including its kilns, stood north of West Parade but about 200m further east. East of the city there was also a large brick yard at Stamp End, just to the east of the lock on the north side of the Witham, but there is no sign that the Council-owned brick pit to the west of Milman Road survived into the 19th century (RAZ 10.41.2, 11.41.2). Further east still, in 1889 there were a group of former brick kilns in the area of stone quarrying along the city boundary, east of Monks Road and south of Greetwell Road (the modern trading estate). To the south of the city, there were two brick works at Cross O‰Û¡ÌÝå»Cliff Hill (Herridge 1999, No.5119) and at South Cliffe, which may have had their origin in the mid-18th century, when the Council tried to stimulate brick production by urging clay diggings to be opened on the South Common (RAZ 11.41.3). The clay pit of the latter became the central lake in the ornamental gardens of South Cliffe House before 1889. There was a third much larger and more mechanised brick works in Bracebridge, but it lay just east of the 1974 city boundary. The last three companies were amalgamated in 1889 into the Lincoln Brick Company (Hill 1974, 125). In 1889, however, much the largest city brick works was the West Cliff Brick Works (Herridge 1999, No.5115) sited along the cliff west of Burton Road north of its junction with Yarborough Road, and superseded by the Albion Works around 1910. This site obviously began as a pit of normal size at the foot of the cliff, but although pits and buildings are marked here on the 1st edition O.S., they were disused by 1889. By then the clay pit had moved up the cliff and cut deeply into it, necessitating a network of tramways and inclines, which took the clay to the works set on the top of the hill. The map shows two large circular structures, possibly clay-washers but more likely circular 'Hoffman' kilns, and ranges of drying sheds with ancillary buildings. Unlike the other pits in Lincoln this was a major industrial site and its remains are important for our understanding of the development of the local brick industry (Robinson 1999). A preliminary survey would be useful here to establish the extent of what survives as earthwork or standing fabric. Certainly proposals for development here must be accompanied by a recording programme aimed at understanding better this important Lincoln industry. We need to know what the various complex structures marked on the 1st edition O.S. were used for. Did the site really have circular 'Hoffman' kilns, and if so, what can be recovered about this innovative technology? Finally, what was the reasoning behind relocating the works site itself to the hill top? Is this a sign that the bricks form here were transported by cart into Lindsey rather than by railway or canal?As expressions of the industrial re-birth of the city we are particularly interested in the dates at which the yards were established. The kiln sites themselves will also be of interest. Presumably most employed scotch kilns, but there has been great interest in the development of kiln technology and the Lincoln examples should be set within the currently proposed national sequence elucidated in the Step 1 Report (Simcoe 1998",Summary,The RAZ elements are mapped following the sites‰Û¡ÌÝå» depiction on the 1889 O.S. map and including a 10m wide extension on each side to accommodate buried features not mapped.,Boundary Description,,Lincoln Archaeological Resource Assessment,11.42,Research Agenda Zone,,,,,,,,LARA RAZs.shp,DRAWING,11.42,
